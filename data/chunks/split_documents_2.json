We remember him fondly. He was an inspiration and guide for the establishment of the Howard W. Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies.__Armand served as a founding member of the Mormon Studies Council at CGU and taught in CGU\\u2019s Mormon Studies program. Below are tributes from colleagues, friends, and students._\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2013\\n\\n**Matthew Bowman**  \\n**Howard W. Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies, Claremont Graduate University**\\n\\nI first encountered Armand Mauss\\u2019s\\u00a0_The Angel and the Beehive_in the early years of my graduate school training: I was hunting for some material on contemporary Mormon worship practices, and I found that in his book.\\u00a0But I found a lot more than that as well. \\u00a0Mauss\\u2019s book has now for twenty-five years been the best comprehensive work on twentieth century Mormon history we have. It managed to both be among the first thorough works on the topic, but also to set the parameters and narrative arc that have structured nearly all work on twentieth century Mormon history since. Mauss\\u2019s model of assimilation and retrenchment (and his follow-up works that have extended his interpretation to the periods after the timeframe of the book ends) have proven durable and persuasive to historians working on a wide range of topics. The book has become a firm canopy that has proven able to shelter and anchor a range of research.\\n\\nI\\u2019m convinced the book will remain part of the Mormon studies canon even as the work which follows it transcends it. In part, of course, Mauss pointed the way there himself, with his followup\\u00a0_All Abraham\\u2019s Children_, a study of race and Mormonism which illustrated how many stories beyond the white, male, Utah centers of Mormon power remain to be told. More, we have begun to see Mormon studies branch beyond the historians who have embraced it so far; more and more scholars of multiple disciplines have begun taking the tradition seriously\\u2014and as that has happened, the shelves in the BX8600 section of the library have begun to fill with books both building on and dissenting from\\u00a0_The Angel and the Beehive_\\u2014though all still owe it a debt.\\n\\nAfter I finished my graduate training I got to know Armand personally, and discovered that his rigor, generosity, and imagination characterized him as a mentor, friend, and guide. When I took the Hunter Chair, Armand became one of those figures I consulted with regularly for counsel and encouragement. He will be missed.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**R. Randall Huff**  \\n**Past Chairman of the Mormon Studies Council and the Howard W. Hunter Foundation**\\n\\nArmand was perhaps the most proactive member of our Mormon Studies Council.\\u00a0 He was also an adjunct professor at Claremont Graduation University, and was very knowledgeable about issues surrounding blacks and the Priesthood.\\u00a0 But Armand\\u2019s influence extended well beyond that.\\u00a0 He was one of the most proactive on our Council on many different topics.\\u00a0 He constantly raised questions about what we were doing to make sure we were doing our best.\\u00a0 He was particularly fond of and protective of our students.\\u00a0 He always tried to get us to be more supportive of students and their economic challenges.\\n\\nHe was heavily involved in fund-raising, and contributed far more than most of us given the differences in our incomes.\\u00a0 He was a watchdog of our finances, and routinely questioned how we dealt with our funds, both from a treasury and a banking standpoint.\\u00a0 I don\\u2019t know if there was anyone who loved and supported the Mormon Studies program at CGU more than Armand.\\u00a0 He will be sorely missed by so many, but his profound influence will live on.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Jana Riess**  \\n**Author of _The Next Mormons_**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Tributes to Armand Mauss - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/tributes-to-armand-mauss/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Jana Riess**  \\n**Author of _The Next Mormons_**\\n\\nSince I was trained as a historian and not a social scientist, it was with some trepidation that I told Armand years ago that I was thinking about diving into a large-scale research project about contemporary young Mormons. What became _The Next Mormons_ was possible in no small part because of Armand\\u2019s willing assistance with many aspects of the project, as he offered feedback on early drafts of survey questions, donated to the Kickstarter campaign that funded the national survey, and read and commented on two chapters in progress. That same generosity of spirit was also apparent when we served together on the _Dialogue_ board. Armand was by that time in his late seventies and early eighties.\\n\\nPlenty of other people look at retirement as a time to enjoy a long-earned respite from work, and a chance to indulge personal interests. (Believe me, I\\u2019m not judging.) This was not Armand\\u2019s approach. He devoted himself to the journal and the people associated with it. I count myself as tremendously lucky that our years on the board overlapped. I will miss his keen intellect, vibrant sense of humor, and equally vibrant Hawaiian shirts. God be with him till we meet again.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Christie Frandsen and Amanda Haslam Wirtz**  \\n**Chairs, Mormon Studies Council**\\n\\nThe Mormon Studies Council of Claremont Graduate University joins with the rest of the LDS scholarly community in mourning the passing of our beloved Armand Mauss, the \\u201cfounding father\\u201d of the Mormon Studies program at CGU. He was a giant among LDS scholars and leaves a legacy of ground-breaking and standard-setting work that might never be matched. He was a visionary who saw the powerful good that could come from establishing collegial and personal relationships between LDS scholars and scholars in the broader academy.\\n\\nIt was this vision of his that gave birth to the Howard W. Hunter Foundation and Chair of Mormon Studies at CGU, and it was his indefatigable support that has kept it alive and growing. His energetic, always optimistic, sometimes reproving voice will be profoundly missed but never forgotten at our Council meetings. He was never fond of words of praise, and so we leave him with what he would far rather receive as a tribute at his death: our resolute pledge to continue the great work to which he devoted the last years of his extraordinary life.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Patrick Mason**  \\n**Leonard J. Arrington Chair of Mormon Culture, Utah State University**  \\n**Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies, Claremont Graduate University, 2011-2019**\\n\\nThe academic field of Mormon studies lost one of its greatest pioneers and champions when Armand Lind Mauss passed away. In a field created and dominated over the past half century by\\u00a0American\\u00a0historians, Mauss was Mormon studies\\u2019 preeminent social scientist. He authored a number of influential studies late in his career that transformed the way we think about Mormonism, the Mormon people, and\\u2014somewhat ironically\\u2014Mormonism\\u2019s historical development.\\u00a0He was an energetic and generous supporter of some of the key institutions that provide the intellectual and organizational scaffolding for the field. He was a devoted scholar, teacher, friend, mentor, father, and husband, and will be greatly missed.\\n\\nHaving retired to Orange County, he was in the right place at the right time when Claremont Graduate University began considering the possibility of\\u00a0creating\\u00a0an endowed professorship in Mormon studies.\\n\\nMauss\\u00a0taught the first Mormon studies courses at CGU from 2005-2008, energetically served on the Mormon Studies Council\\u00a0for several years, and was an indispensable part of the establishment and success of the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies.\\n\\nThose who care both about Mormonism and the life of the mind stand on the shoulders of\\u00a0a generation of\\u00a0giants\\u00a0(some of whom, fortunately, are still with us). In Armand Mauss\\u2019s passing, we lose\\u00a0one of these\\u00a0giants, one\\u00a0whose exterior was stern and exacting but whose heart more than filled his large frame.\\u00a0Those of us who knew Armand personally will never forget him, and all of us are in his debt.\\u00a0How will we repay the debt? I think I know what Armand would say: read, think, write, and live honestly. After all, what good is any other way?\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Michael McBride**  \\n**Professor of Economics & Religious Studies, University of California, Irvine**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Tributes to Armand Mauss - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/tributes-to-armand-mauss/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"To the world, Armand is one of the great figures of Mormon Studies and its preeminent social scientist.\\u00a0 To me, Armand was a mentor and, more importantly, a dear friend.\\u00a0 He happily let me join his class on the social science of Mormonism back in the early days of the CGU Mormon Studies program, and I learned just as much during our conversations while we carpooled each week from Irvine to Claremont as I did in the class.\\u00a0 My own foray into Mormon Studies grew out of discussions we had about the social science of religion and the differences between his field of sociology and my field of economics.\\u00a0 He was kind enough to read drafts of my work and offer his typical incisive but constructive criticism, and he later recruited me to serve with him on the _Dialogue_ Board of Directors.\\n\\nBut nothing is more memorable than the time my wife Caroline and I spent with him and his wife Ruth getting lunch at Mimi\\u2019s Cafe or in our home discussing all things Mormon Studies and culture.\\u00a0 He loved to share stories about the field\\u2019s early days and always bemoaned with a smile the fact that the younger generation so often had to sort out their own understanding of issues confronted by others decades before.\\u00a0 I count myself lucky that his retirement to Irvine coincided with my getting hired at UC Irvine.\\u00a0 I count myself even luckier that I was able to spend so much time in his company.\\u00a0 I am saddened by the news of his death but glad to celebrate his life and memory.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Claudia Bushman**  \\n**Professor Emerita of American Studies, Columbia University**\\n\\nFarewell, Armand, my beloved fellow California Mormon.\\u00a0 How I will miss you, your keen insights, your straight talk, your unceasing Labors toward good ends.\\u00a0 All best to you and Ruth.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Richard Bushman**  \\n**Professor Emeritus, Columbia University**  \\n**Inaugural Holder of the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies**\\n\\nI have said that Armand Mauss was the premier theorist of Mormonism in our generation.\\u00a0 His conception of the internal dynamics of the Church\\u2019s social development was really unmatched.\\u00a0 He was a great mind and a great soul.\\u00a0 Who was more generous with his time and attention than Armand?\\u00a0 I loved him.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Joseph Bentley**  \\n**Chair of the CGU Mormon Studies Council, 2005-2010**\\n\\nI have always regarded Armand as an indispensable cog in that program.\\u00a0 While I was pleased to invite Richard Bushman to apply for the Howard W. Hunter professorship, then oversaw much of the program\\u2019s development during its formative years, it was Armand who really put the rubber on the road.\\n\\nI think he was the first ever to teach any courses in Mormon Studies at CGU.\\u00a0 He started as an adjunct professor soon after I brought him onto the MS Council in 2004 and he taught for the next four years until the Bushmans arrived in 2008.\\u00a0 His credibility with other faculty members enabled his appointment as a most effective member of the search committee, where he guided the selection of Richard Bushman as a senior professor. He was instrumental in creating the highly active Claremont Mormon Studies Student Association, then continued as our liaison with it and with the School of Religion for about a decade.\\n\\nIn the latter capacity, he helped to administer the combined operating budget under the 2006 endowment agreement between CGU and the Hunter Foundation.\\u00a0 That was especially crucial during CGU\\u2019s financial meltdown during the national financial crisis, beginning in late 2008 while I was out of the country.\\u00a0 Even with his limited retirement resources, he annually donated all that he could afford to the CGU Hunter endowment, setting a superb example.\\n\\nIn his own humble but scholarly way, Armand was faithful and true and loyal to God, to gospel principles and to sound academics. In short, he was our \\u201cman for all seasons,\\u201d and \\u201cfor all reasons,\\u201d at CGU.\\u00a0 I loved the man and always will.\\u00a0 I shall miss him, as will all who served with him until he retired from that service to care for his beloved wife Ruth.\\u00a0 My desire is to be reunited with both of them in a higher realm some day!\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Rick Richmond**  \\n**Chairman of the Howard W.

Her parents, converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, raised Ann in the church. She is married to a Latter-day Saint man, has two young children, and works as a secondary school teacher in Ibadan.\\n\\nAnn is particularly attracted to Latter-day Saint teachings about the importance of the family and the emphasis on unity and love within the family. She also sees the church as a vehicle for social mobility, as those who join the church generally improve their English fluency and literacy since meetings are held in English. However, Ann notes the downside of conducting meetings in English, as it becomes difficult for the local congregations to retain converts if the converts do not have fluent English. She also notes the cultural divisions that are present in many Latter-day Saint congregations in Nigeria, as Yoruba, Igbo, and others tend to socialize within their ethnic groups rather than across them.\\n\\nShe finds that patriarchal attitudes common in Nigeria do seep into the church and she hopes that priesthood holders work to live up to the ideals espoused by the church. She is encouraged by the fact that in recent years, more black Africans have been added into West Africa Area church leadership. She emphasized the importance of black Area leadership in Africa saying, \\u201cThey \\\\[black church Area leaders\\\\] understand our plight, and they understand where we are coming from.\\u201d\\n\\nAnn hopes to one day do something in her community to relieve people\\u2019s suffering.

By this time, Drucker had already led several different lives: first fleeing the Nazis in Germany due to his critical journalism, then working in London as a bank economist, and finally residing in New York and Vermont where he held professorships in philosophy, politics, and management. Despite his numerous accomplishments, it was only after arriving at CGU that he embarked on his most productive phase. It was during this period that he produced the majority of his prolific writing and founded the school that now bears his name.\\n\\nWhat Drucker discovered at CGU \\u2014 the freedom to explore both new and established interests and the opportunity to develop ideas that would revolutionize business and society in the 21st Century \\u2014 is what SOAR now offers to successful people seeking their next journey. With a foundation firmly rooted in both the liberal arts and business, CGU and the Drucker School of Management offer SOAR fellows the chance to embark on a new chapter of their lives, emphasizing personal development, societal impact, and transformative education. If you, like Peter Drucker, envision the most productive years of your life still ahead, SOAR can help you connect with your purpose and start afresh.\\n\\nWhat Comes After Success?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nWith significant emphasis on \\u201cmaking it\\u201d in their career, many accomplished people experience a sense of loss following their achievements, accompanied by a lack of direction in navigating their future. Through SOAR, you will discover new pathways to meaning, community, and purpose within the unique learning environment of Claremont Graduate University, an institution focused solely on graduate-level education:\\n\\n##### Personal development + education + community of learners = the path to reinvention\\n\\nAt Claremont Graduate University, we firmly believe in the power of thoughtful transition. When your career trajectory shifts or comes to an end, and you\\u2019re seeking a new journey to embark on, it\\u2019s time to join the path to personal revitalization. SOAR provides fellows with the opportunity to Seek, Observe, Act, and Renew, empowering them to make creative decisions about the next steps in their lives.\\n\\nTogether with your SOAR peers, you will experience the energizing effects of interpersonal exchanges. With a built-in community of individuals, you\\u2019ll feel the camaraderie that comes from exploring new interests and learning from world class professors and lecturers in a safe environment to think, consider, be vulnerable, and feel supported.\\n\\nSocietal Impact\\n---------------\\n\\nThe SOAR program enables people to connect themselves and their journey to the complex challenges facing our world. Participants will engage in activities that allow them to explore their passions, learn about critical challenges facing the world, have an immediate impact, and begin to craft what they want to do next. Our collective interest in Societal Impact will be supported by the SOAR curriculum as well as speakers and general networking opportunities.\\n\\nTime Commitment\\n---------------\\n\\nThe SOAR Program is three sessions covering all described material. Online meetings are held before and after the core three-day session is held at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California. The annual sequence is Course 1 in Fall, Course 2 in Spring, and Course 3, a capstone experience, occurring annually.

You will reflect on your own personal narrative and then, like a curator, tell that story through objects in a way that considers how the audience will interpret you. We will ask you to delve into what stories you have told in the past, what you believe, what you have accomplished, what story you want to tell now, and what story you might want to tell in the future.\\n*   **Great Questions** uses books, texts, and poems to engage with some of the timeless questions that shape the human journey: What is truth? How do you know it? What is forgiveness? What is loss? What is joy? What is wonder? What does it mean to be a person? What is a life well-lived?\\n*   **Transitions** uncovers the predictable emotions and challenges of change. You will consider your own relationship with change and learn the tools and mindsets to navigate any transition with awareness, patience, positivity, and intention. This course helps you to integrate your life up until this point and prepare to move forward into your next phase.\\n*   **Purpose and Impact** helps you cultivate your own sense of purpose \\u2014 finding the intersection between what you care about, what you are good at, and what the world needs \\u2013 and ultimately define what you want your next contribution to be.\\n*   **Design Your Life** brings you into the present moment to create awareness of what drives you and what gives you energy. With this foundation, you will apply design thinking tools and approaches as you generate and experiment with different ideas for what you want to grow into next.\\n\\nFor a SOAR podcast and video, see  \\n[Reinventing Yourself In Retirement With Steve Tarr](https://www.retiresoonerteam.com/podcasts/192-reinventing-yourself-in-retirement-with-steve-tarr/)  \\n(please note the dates, below, have been updated)\\n\\nApplication Guidelines\\n----------------------\\n\\n### Requirements Summary\\n\\n| Item | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Statement of Purpose | Yes |\\n| Resume | Yes |\\n\\n#### SOAR Program Admission Guidelines\\n\\nThe admission process for the SOAR Program will focus on admitting qualified individual fellows who will gain from the program, while also building a cohort of diverse fellows who will learn and benefit from each other.

Driven by his desire to document this momentous occasion and a need to pass the time, Kahn wired his Motorola Startac flip phone to his Casio QV-10 digital camera, which he then connected to his laptop using speakerphone wiring ripped from his car. When baby Sophie was born, Kahn held his daughter in one hand and took her photo with the other, then instantly sent the image to over 2,000 people.\\n\\nThe impact of this invention cannot be understated. The ability to capture and instantly share imagery has changed the way we interact with the world and with one another. Anyone with a camera phone may now be a journalist, publisher, consumer, artist, or documentarian. The impact of image-based social media applications is debated in the highest courts, while their user numbers continue to grow. Instagram alone claimed 1.3 billion users in 2020.\\n\\nPhillippe Kahn himself has continued to be hugely influential in the tech world. He founded several software companies including LightSurf whose picture-messaging technology is used today by Sprint, Verizon, and other major carriers. Kahn has been granted hundreds of patents for innovations related to artificial intelligence, wearable technologies, telecommunications, and motion-detection.\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nShare\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Sound Bytes with Walt Mossberg \\u2014 Paul Gray PC Museum\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/paul-gray-pc-museum/2022/01/16/sound-bytes-with-walt-mossberg/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**February 7, 2021 7:00pm PST**  \\n**Jed Woodworth and Lisa Olsen Tait on \\u201cMaking _Saints_: Behind the Scenes of the Church\\u2019s New Multi-Volume History\\u201d**\\n\\nThis presentation explores the genesis and writing of the Church\\u2019s new official\\u00a0history.

She joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a child and was particularly drawn to its teachings about families. She served a mission in Benin, Nigeria. She credits her mission with helping her to become less reserved and to talk to strangers, which ultimately, she recounts, led to her receiving a job offer to become a teacher.\\n\\nAfter returning home from her mission and finding it difficult to pursue her educational and professional goals, she decided to move from Calabar to Ibadan, Nigeria, where she now teaches children. This decision to relocate to an entirely new location was a difficult one, but as she told herself as she began contemplating her move, \\u201cSometimes for you to succeed you need to leave your comfort zone and go out there.\\u201d After obtaining her father\\u2019s permission to relocate, she moved to Ibadan and found that the church eased her transition, as she found friendly Latter-day Saints there who invited her into their homes and befriended her.\\n\\nMary relates that it\\u2019s not always easy to be a Latter-day Saint in Nigeria, as the church has a reputation for being a cult. However, she finds the skills, values, and insights taught by the church very rewarding. Reflecting on the Proclamation to the Family, she says that she has \\u201ccome to understand that I am not a nobody. I am somebody, and I have somebody that is a king, somebody that has a palace, and I have His DNA \\u2026. This just makes me feel special, makes me feel that we are all like Him.

CGU joins numerous universities across the country in signing the pledge but is the first to publicly announce its commitment.\\n\\n\\u201cI believe it\\u2019s important for us to go on record, not only by signing the NAACP pledge but by publicly sharing our belief in diversity, equity, and inclusion in all areas of university life: enrollment, hiring, and campus culture,\\u201d University President Len Jessup said.\\n\\nDuring Jessup\\u2019s five-year tenure as president, the number of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) students has grown to 54 percent of the domestic student population, up from 44 percent in the year before his arrival. In addition, 63 percent of tenured or tenure-track faculty hired since 2018 are BIPOC, as are 43 percent of Board of Trustees members brought aboard since 2018.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is by no means a victory lap. This is a continuous process, and much remains to be done,\\u201d Jessup said. \\u201cWe cannot change the past\\u2014the good or the bad\\u2014but we can commit to the present and the future.\\u201d\\n\\nThat commitment is manifested in the university\\u2019s [Strategic Plan](https://www.cgu.edu/about/strategic-plan/), which was approved on March 8, 2020, and includes among its five goals fostering an academic community of inclusive excellence. Achieving this includes:\\n\\n*   Prioritizing diversity planning and the implementation of initiatives that positively and measurably impact the campus community\\n*   Promoting the recruitment, retention, success, and full participation of diverse faculty, staff, students, alumni, and trustees\\n*   Fostering a sense of respect and just practice across the campus while promoting research, creative work, and community outreach that impact positive social change\\n\\n\\u201cThe university has made significant progress in our commitment to recruit and retain diverse students, staff, faculty, and trustees,\\u201d said Quamina Carter, vice president of student affairs and chair of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee. \\u201cDiversity enhances intellectual discourse, broadens perspectives, and prepares our scholars for this increasingly interconnected world. I am proud to be part of CGU\\u2019s reaffirmation to developing global citizens through transformative graduate education.\\u201d\\n\\nThe NAACP welcomed the news of CGU\\u2019s commitment to the pledge.\\n\\n\\u201cI applaud Claremont Graduate University for signing the Diversity No Matter What pledge,\\u201d said Ivory A. Toldson, PhD, national director of education innovation and research. \\u201cThis demonstrates their commitment to creating and sustaining a culture of inclusion, belonging, and respect for the benefit of all students\\u2014and therefore our society.\\n\\n\\u201cClaremont Graduate University is taking concrete steps to ensure that higher education reflects the nation\\u2019s diversity and advances equity and justice for historically underrepresented students. I hope that more colleges and universities will follow their example and join us in this vital effort.\\u201d\\n\\n###\\n\\n**About Claremont Graduate University**  \\n[Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu/), 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, serves students in the region, the nation, and beyond.

I was shocked. My father was the backbone of the family and after his death we faced numerous hardships. Mother was left homeless with four children to raise alone. We started moving from place to place and sometimes spent nights just outside if weather was warm. When we were hungry, I picked leftover food from garbages. It was not easy to survive and I learned a lot from this hardship. Now, I tend to compare other problems with that period of my life and toughen up thinking I survived that and can get over this.\\n\\nI became a member of the church at the age of starting seminary classes, which was the right choice in pivotal moment of my life. The classes started at the sun rise, which looked fabulous in the Eastern province. The seminary children used to watch this beautiful scene daily. Although, there were drunkards and stray dogs that often chased us in dark mornings, it became my fond memory later in life after I relocated to Darkhan. To this day, we are good friends, possibly because we got over a lot together. We used to pick one another up from their homes to protect ourselves as much as we could and meanwhile, we learned a lot from one another. For instance, choosing the right friends, as it helps you meet new people or let people who match with your personality be around you, especially when you live in a new place\\u2026.\\n\\nNext, I learned to stick to my values. If I hadn\\u2019t been perseverant about going to seminary, I would not stay in the church to this day.\\n\\nLastly, I learned the ability to understand, love, and accept others as they are. The first time I went abroad was going to Hong Kong after marrying to my husband. Until I saw the different country in 2016, I used to be pessimistic about Mongolia and often thought to myself why the people were so poor and hostile to one another. Then, after living in Hong Kong for 10 days, and visiting the immaculately clean temple. I wanted to live in the beautiful luxurious place longer, but during the flight back to Mongolia, I looked out the window and saw another beautiful place. I begun to see the other side of my livelihood and the country as well and felt proud to be a Mongolian. Later, I could see the hardships of my country from a mother\\u2019s perspective after becoming a mother.\\n\\nI serve my society through the church. I help malnourished children and women and girls. While working with two organizations in 2020, I was exposed to even worse social issues. One of organizations worked with children of alcoholics. I could not help myself blaming the society I was born in and wondered why the young generation pay the price of their parents\\u2019 mistakes; they can\\u2019t get an education, they can\\u2019t eat proper food? I saw this was one of the obstacles for their development. I have seen also parenting resources are limited for both the Mongolian education system and adults equally. I want to do something to fill this gap in future and I hope to achieve it in the reality.\\n\\nI am the only active Christian in my family. My mother and sister are inactive, but they agree with the doctrine. My in-laws live in the countryside and follow Mongolian traditions, which I find difficult. My father-in-law used to deny Christianity and he is slowly getting better. After marriage, a daughter-in-law is supposed to offer first cup of tea to the spirits and the fire. On Lunar New Year, the locals have a ritual called \\u201csun worship\\u201d and I had to participate. It seemed the people were worshiping something artificial, so I said to my father-in-law that doing this would not mean we were worshipping. He said, \\u201cOf course, our heritage is important,\\u201d and the doctrine teaches us not to be critical or against them. Now my in-laws have a relative understanding of our religion.\\n\\n![Image 2: Enkhtsetseg Mamaljav](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/11/enhtsetseg-2-1.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Enkhtsetseg Mamaljav - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/mamaljav/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 3: Enkhtsetseg Mamaljav](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/11/enhtsetseg-4-1.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Enkhtsetseg Mamaljav - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/mamaljav/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Our PhD program promotes practice-based scholarship that embraces the scientific method to better understand how people and societies make decisions.\\n\\nStudents are exposed to cutting-edge research in international economics and behavioral and applied microeconomics.

Stacy is a professor at Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s School of Community and Global Health (SCGH). Stacy was one of the first to apply basic research on automatic memory processes, multiple memory systems in the brain, and implicit cognition to health habits and addiction. He co-edited the first book on _Implicit Cognition and Addiction_. This approach has spawned many studies on implicit cognition in health behavior and helps explain why so many people engage in behaviors that are habit forming but harmful in the long run.\\n\\nStacy received his doctorate in social and personality psychology, with a health psychology focus, from the University of California, Riverside. He has held postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Washington and the University of Southern California and held positions at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California, where he was full professor with tenure in the Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine. He moved to Claremont Graduate University in 2008 as professor and associate dean of faculty affairs. In 2018, he became interim dean for SCGH.\\n\\nHis research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for many years. As examples, he has been principal investigator (PI) on eight previous NIH RO1 projects and a large NIH P50 center translating basic research to health behavior and addictions. He has been co-PI on previous successful preventive intervention trials on drug and tobacco use (recommended for widespread use by NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and co-investigator on several neural imaging projects studying habit processes.\\n\\nHis most recent NIH-funded randomized trial found support for a new preventive electronic intervention on reducing infection risk and increasing screening in drug users at risk for hepatitis b/c and HIV. His most recent epidemiologic study (funded by the Food and Drug Administration) has uncovered major causes of increases in electronic tobacco use and opioid use among at-risk youth in a large 3-year cohort study. He has also conducted research on dietary interventions and electronic habit change modalities (via laptops and internet devices such as tablet computers and cell phones) and seeks to expand his approach to interventions on physical activity. His NIH grants have resulted in a diverse range of publications in peer reviewed scientific journals across fields of behavioral medicine, preventive medicine, public health, and psychology. A few examples are: _Journal of Behavioral Medicine_, _Health Psychology_, _American Journal of Public Health_, _Pediatrics, Social Science and Medicine, Addiction_, _Addiction Biology, Behavioural Brain Research_, _Psychological Assessment_, _Annual Review of Clinical Psychology_.

According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,225,195 Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) living in the US (alone or in combination with one or more other races). This group represents about 0.4 percent of the US population. California is second only to Hawaii in the number of NHPIs, with 286,145 NHPIs living in California. The five largest NHPI populations in California are Native Hawaiian, Chamorro/Guamanian, Samoan, Tongan, and Marshallese (Table 1). Pacific Islanders (PIs) represent a wide diversity of ethnic populations, with over 19 census defined groups that each have their own culture, language, traditions, health and world perspectives, and political and migration history. Some of these PI populations have close ties to the US territories and jurisdictions in the Pacific, including American Samoa, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Commonwealth Nations of the Mariana Islands. Other groups such as Tongans have migrated from their small island nations in search of higher earnings to support families back home.\\n\\nDespite their cultural differences, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders generally face high socioeconomic and language barriers to accessing health care. According to the data from 2010 American Community Survey, 9.1% of Native Hawaiians, 12.2% of Chamorro/Guamanian, and 14.3% of Samoan had less than a high school degree, compared with 16.1% of non-Hispanic whites. Furthermore, 10.0% of Native Hawaiians, 10.8% of Chamorro/Guamanian, 14.4% of Samoans, and 20.0% of Tongans lived below 100% Federal Poverty Level, compared with 12% of non-Hispanic whites. About 5.5% of Native Hawaiian, 7.3% of Chamorro/Guamanian, 11.7% of Samoan, and 9.0% of Tongan reported receiving public assistance, compared with 4.4% of non-Hispanic whites. Additionally, 1.8% Native Hawaiian, 5.7% Chamorro/Guamanian, 13.3% of Samoan, and 20.3% of Tongan reported having limited English proficiency compared to 13.8% of non-Hispanic Whites (Table 1).\\n\\n### Table 1: Characteristics of five Pacific Islander populations and non-Hispanic whites in California (US Census, 2010)\\n\\n| \\u00a0 | **Race alone** | **Race/ethnicity inclusive of all other races** | **%<HS  \\nDegree** | **<100%  \\nFPL** a | **% Public  \\nAssistance** b | **% Limited**  \\n**English Proficient** c |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Native Hawaiian** | **21,423** | **74,932** | **9.1%** | **10.0%** | **5.5%** | **1.8%** |\\n| **Chamorro/  \\nGuamanian** | **24,299** | **44,425** | **12.2%** | **10.8%** | **7.3%** | **5.7%** |\\n| **Samoan** | **40,900** | **60,876** | **14.3%** | **14.4%** | **11.7%** | **13.3%** |\\n| **Tongan** | **18,329** | **22,893** | **17.8%** | **20.0%** | **9.0%** | **20.3%** |\\n| **Marshallese** | **1,559** | **1,761** | **n/a** | **n/a** | **n/a** | **n/a** |\\n| **NH Whites** | **21,453,934** | **22,953,374** | **16.1%** | **12.0%** | **4.4%** | **13.8%** |\\n\\nData from 2010 American Community Survey 5-year selected population tables  \\nData from 2010 SF2 100% Decennial Census\\n\\na Percentage of families and people whose income in the past 12 months is below the poverty line  \\nb With Food Stamp/SNAP benefits in the past 12 months  \\nc Speak English less than \\\"very well\\\"  \\nn/a = data not available\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Communities \\u2014 Weaving an Islander Network for Cancer Awareness, Research, and Training\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/wincart/communities/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Between 1992-2002, while breast cancer incidence rates decreased or remained the same for all other racial/ethnic groups, they increased for Asian Pacific Islanders (Edwards et al., 2005). Compared to nearly all other ethnic groups, PIs suffer from higher prevalence\\u2019s of the leading health disparity indicators, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, infant mortality, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, asthma, and cigarette smoking. While data on the cancer needs of Pacific Islanders in the US is sparse, available evidence universally point to critical needs and high barriers to care for this diverse group. Among the primary factors associated with cancer onset, several are of particular concern for Pacific Islanders (CDC, 2002). First, obesity has been implicated as a causal factor in the onset of several cancers (including breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, and kidney cancers), and rates of obesity are high in all Pacific Islander populations. In California, data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) indicate that 32% of Pacific Islanders in California were obese (with a body mass index equal to or greater than 30) and 38% were overweight (with a body mass index between 25-29.9).\\n\\nStudies have also documented the high rates of tobacco use among Pacific Islanders. In a review of tobacco use behaviors among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs), Lew and Tanjasiri (2003) reported that Native Hawaiians, American Samoans, Chuukese and Palauans had rates of use between 42-58% among men, and between 11-67% among women. These smoking rates (with the exception of the Palauan data, which was betel nut use) were among the highest for both genders of all AAPIs. Data from the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicated that 16.3% of NHPIs youth were smokers. While smoking among Asian Americans tends to be a malebehavior, that is not the case for Pacific Islanders. Nearly 18.2% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander females reported current smoking (Rudatsikira, Muula, & Siziya, 2009).\\n\\nFinally, little to nothing is known about the cancer survivor needs and experiences of Pacific Islanders. For instance, despite the fact that breast cancer is the most common cancer for Pacific Islander women, information on ways to ameliorate the significant mental, social and physical health impacts are nearly non-existent. In two studies of differences in breast cancer treatment modalities, AAPI women were found to be less likely to receive radiation or hormonal therapy compared to white women, and more likely to receive a mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery (Chui & Lyerly, 2002; Prehn et al., 2002). It\\u2019s unclear to what extent this reflects Pacific Islander women\\u2019s experiences, and further research must be done into treatment and quality of life experiences with the many PI subgroups.\\n\\n#### Sources\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Communities \\u2014 Weaving an Islander Network for Cancer Awareness, Research, and Training\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/wincart/communities/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"#### Sources\\n\\n*   Rudatsikira E, Muula A, & Siziya S.

He also received a B.A. in Religious Studies from the University of Utah and a B.S. in Psychology from Utah Valley University. Brandon\\u2019s current area of research is on what he calls \\u201cthe metaphysics of the Mormon temple\\u201d which is indicative of a \\u201ccosmoview\\u201d revealed to initiates through their experiences in a Mormon temple. To better understand this phenomenon, Brandon utilizes metaphysicians such as Rene Guenon, Anana Coomaraswamy, Frithjof Schuon, and others to elaborate the revelatory metaphysics of Mormons comparatively with other religions traditions while using the work of Hugh Nibley and others to ground the work of those metaphysicians within distinctly Mormon parameters. This line of research is ultimately meant to get to the heart of the esoteric revelations within Mormonism concerning their views of the origins, purpose, and eventual destiny of humanity in the face of ultimate reality, i.e. God.\\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Current Students - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/current-students/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"March 27, 2021\\n\\n![Image 1: Covid Fear](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/03/Mark-R.jpg)\\n\\n##### **Submitted By:**  \\nMark R\\n\\n##### **Location:** Salt Lake City, UT, USA\\n\\n##### **Story Date:** February 14, 2021\\n\\n##### **Affiliated Tradition:**  \\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n\\n##### **Identity:** Caucasian heterosexual Christian\\n\\n##### **Gender:** Male\\n\\nIn terms of COVID, the first thing that made it real was seeing a lot of empty shelves at the store.

I have been able to improve my knowledge and skills, such as having emotional intelligence and being a better listener. I have been working on understanding others. My biggest struggle is that I have had to adapt to difficult people (mostly coworkers). I have learned about them and myself, which helps me to cope with difficulties that arise. I have considered the natural man within myself and I have chosen to become closer to God.

Professor Samir Chatterjee\\u2019s MyHeart app, for example, helps patients by collecting diagnostic data and other feedback on a daily basis that is monitored remotely by hospital caregivers, who can determine whether intervention is needed.\\n\\n### Proactive Health Management\\n\\nResearch across CGU is addressing root causes of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity, as well as disease management and follow-up care. \\u201cDiseases of despair\\u201d\\u2014drug addiction, depression, and suicide, among others\\u2014are reducing life expectancy, especially in underserved communities. Faculty are studying a range of holistic approaches and interventions that pay particular attention to the needs of these communities.\\n\\n### Healthcare Policy\\n\\nUnderstanding the government labyrinth\\u2014 what makes a policy effective or ineffective\\u2014 can improve social and economic outcomes. Professors in the School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation are studying the relationship between social justice and well-being, and research in the Division of Politics and Economics is focusing on the efficacy of federal health programs such as the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid managed care.\\n\\n### Mindfulness\\n\\nCGU is a leader in the field of Positive Health Psychology, which explores how to maintain physical and mental well-being despite the presence of otherwise harmful physical, social, or environmental conditions.

The Serrano clan is indigenous to the San Bernardino Valley, known today as the Inland Empire. The San Manuel Reservation was established in 1891 and recognized as a sovereign nation with the right of self-government. As an indigenous community, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians\\u2019 origins and history stem from their relationship with the land and to all who share it. Its ancestors have handed down the tradition of expressing themselves through a culture of giving. As one of the largest employers in the Inland Empire, San Manuel is able to answer the call of Yawa\\u2019 (a Serrano word meaning \\u201cto act on one\\u2019s beliefs\\u201d) through partnerships with charitable organizations that make a difference in the lives of thousands of families across the country. It draws upon its history, knowledge, expertise, and cultural values to direct its philanthropic giving in the region, as well as to Native American causes nationwide.\\n\\nFor more information, visit [sanmanuel-nsn.gov](https://www.sanmanuel-nsn.gov/).\\n\\n#### Giving Opportunities\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies and potential giving opportunities, please contact Kristen Andersen-Daley, Vice President, Development & External Relations.\\n\\n[kristen.andersen-daley@cgu.edu](mailto:kristen.andersen-daley@cgu.edu)  \\n909-607-8252\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/ychs/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"What Your Gift Can Do\\n---------------------\\n\\n![Image 1: Dwayne Hunn](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-dwayne-hunn.jpg)\\n\\nDecades ago, Dwayne Hunn returned to the U.S. to attend Claremont Graduate University (CGU) on a fellowship after serving as a Peace Corps volunteer for two years in the poorest chawls of Mumbai, India, at Our Lady\\u2019s Home Orphanage, the Cheshire Home for Paraplegics and Incurables, and other sites.\\u00a0 [More](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/your-lasting-impact/alumnus-pays-it-forward)\\n\\n![Image 2: Laurel Simpson](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-laurel-simpson.jpg)\\n\\nEducation has always been paramount for Laurel Simpson.

This course will therefore focus on the following:\\n\\n*   Lessons learned during the MDG era about the role, value and foci of evaluation\\n*   Key characteristics of evaluation that support development\\n*   The implications for national evaluation agendas\\n\\n### Equity and Responsiveness in Monitoring and Evaluation\\n\\n**Katrina Bledsoe, PhD**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Courses \\u2014 Claremont Evaluation Center - NY\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cec-ny/programs/courses/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Katrina Bledsoe, PhD**\\n\\nMonitoring and evaluation are key components to understanding the unique factors that influence policies, programs, governments, and societies. They are also tools that can be used to ensure equity and cultural responsiveness. Equitable and responsive evaluation focuses on who should be involved in decision-making; what questions should be asked and understanding how these questions are contextually grounded; what indicators are most representative of the context; what kinds of data will ensure a more accurate assessment; and in what manner data should be analyzed to enable all voices to be heard. Although most stakeholders will often be commissioners and consumers of evaluations, they will also be the people who are most in a position to guide the evaluation in ensuring equity and responsiveness.\\n\\nThis half-day, interactive course includes some necessary foundation topics, as well as plenty of discussion and opportunities to think about equity and responsiveness in monitoring and evaluation. We will examine:\\n\\n*   What is meant by equity and responsiveness\\n*   Developing evaluation questions with an eye towards equity\\n*   Developing context-appropriate indicators of progress and success\\n*   Collecting and analyzing data so that it is representative of the myriad of groups that policies and programs cover\\n*   Becoming a savvy consumer of evaluation\\n\\n### Evaluation as a Leadership Function\\n\\n**Michael Quinn Patton, PhD**\\n\\nLeadership development has become one of the most highly valued forms of capacity-building. The challenges of leading modern, complex organizations have generated great interest. At the same time, organizations of all kinds are facing increasing demands for accountability and evaluation. This course puts these two trends together by addressing evaluation as a key leadership function.\\n\\nEvaluation is much more than compliance reporting, mandated paperwork, and meeting funders\\u2019 monitoring demands. Evaluation as a leadership function places the emphasis where it should be: ensuring that programs, organizations, and initiatives are having desired impacts in accordance with their mission. This unique course will introduce: reality-testing, results-oriented, learning-focused leadership for sustainable development.\\n\\n*   The reality-testing dimension focuses on the challenges of overcoming selective perception, biases, misinformation, and other barriers that leaders experience in attempting to assess whether what they think is happening in their organizations is what is actually happening.\\n*   The results-oriented focus concerns how leaders are involved in setting an organization\\u2019s direction and then doing reality-testing to determine the extent to which desired results are being attained.\\n*   The learning-focused dimension concerns how leaders create a culture of learning and model learning in their own behaviors.\\n\\nBeing committed to reality-testing, staying results-oriented, and being serious about learning are grounded in evaluative thinking and meaningful performance measurement. Reality-testing, results-oriented, learning-focused leaders are essential for creating and sustaining effective learning organizations that make a difference in the world. In examining evaluation as a leadership function, the course incorporates social science research and evaluation evidence on factors related to organizational effectiveness. The process draws on both research and experience to provide concrete, practical guidance about how to use evaluation to create a learning organization for increased organizational effectiveness.\\n\\n### Leadership for Transformative Change in the SDG Era\\n\\n**Michael Quinn Patton, PhD**\\n\\nWe inhabit a world in which an increasing sense of urgency calls for transformational change. The compelling vision represented by the Sustainable Development Goals, the latest data on accelerating climate change, and the global problems that transcend national borders are challenges that require new ways of thinking, acting, and evaluating. Slow, incremental change is not sufficient. But what does transformational change mean? How is it done? How would we know? Evaluation is no longer just a back-end activity in which evaluators come in to examine what happened after an initiative is over. Evaluators are now involved at the front-end, participating in the design of initiatives, bringing to bear accumulated evaluation knowledge about what works and what doesn\\u2019t, and ensuring that evaluative thinking and evaluability are built into new endeavors from the beginning.\\n\\nThis leading edge course is for those who share that sense of urgency that everything we do must accelerate the pace of sustainable development solutions \\u2013 including evaluation. This course will examine:\\n\\n*   Theories of change related to transformative change\\n*   Dimensions of transformative change that constitute an evaluation framework\\n\\n### Framing the Right Questions and Picking the Right Approach: An Overview\\n\\n**Tarek Azzam, PhD**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Courses \\u2014 Claremont Evaluation Center - NY\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cec-ny/programs/courses/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Tarek Azzam, PhD**\\n\\nEvery time we try something new, we often ask ourselves, \\u201cIs it better? What makes it good, what is its value, and what impact is it having?\\u201d These are common questions that are often used in evaluations of anything from small interventions to large-scale policies. The identification of the most important questions in evaluation is the most important first step in the evaluation design process, because it forms the foundation of a useful, credible, and rigorous evaluation. It is important to make sure the questions are driving the choice of evaluation methods and not the other way around. Once questions have been identified then the evaluation must integrate three facets that impact the design:\\n\\n*   Program context (e.g., stakeholders, politics, maturity of the program, complexity of the program, etc.)\\n*   Evaluators (e.g., level of expertise, theoretical perspectives, competency, etc.)\\n*   Evaluation methods (e.g., type of design, interviews, surveys, case studies, RCTs, etc.)\\n\\n### Navigating the Leadership Labyrinth: Parts 1 & 2\\n\\n**Michelle Bligh, PhD**\\n\\nThere is no question that leadership profoundly affects our lives through our roles in various types of organizations. As an area of study, leadership is a very complicated and elusive subject to understand and explain, making it ideally suited to approach from different disciplines and perspectives. Throughout history, the successes and failures of individuals, groups, organizations, and societies have been attributed to leadership.\\u00a0 Leadership is more than just a collection of tools and tips, or even skills and competencies; the essence of an individual\\u2019s leadership is fundamentally shaped by her or his values, philosophies, and beliefs. In this course, we will examine:\\n\\n*   The leadership labyrinth \\u2013 the various challenges and opportunities that uniquely face each individual rooted in gender, race, ethnicity, age, class, citizenship, ability, and experience\\n*   How to define effective leadership, and how can you develop your identity both as a leader and as a proactive follower\\n*   How to develop inclusive leadership abilities to respond to the new challenges and changing demands of a global world\\n*   What successful 21st-century leaderships looks like, drawing on theories of philosophy and ethics, charismatic and transformational leadership, and followership\\n*   Constructs critical to practicing inclusive leadership in modern organizations, including empowerment, authenticity, accountability, courage, influence, and humility\\n\\n### Ethical Considerations in the New Global Evaluation Landscape\\n\\n**Michael Scriven, PhD**\\n\\nCourse description to come.\\n\\nAdditional Courses: Leadership Certificate Program in Evaluation and SDG Spring 2018\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Adaptive Learning \\u2013 A Pivotal Competence\\n\\n**Chris Soderquist**\\n\\nWhen a process to develop and execute public health strategies fails to achieve desired impacts, it\\u2019s often assumed the process was wrong or the right people weren\\u2019t involved. In many cases, it might be something else. Just like soccer players need to know how to dribble, pass and shoot the ball before running an offensive play, those involved in improvement efforts and strategy development needs certain skills in order to succeed. These skills (known as enabling competencies) are: systems thinking, conversational capacity, and \\u201cyes to the mess.\\u201d During the course \\u2013 through several real world examples from community and public policy initiatives \\u2013 participants will learn the following:\\n\\n*   Why these competencies are overlooked in developing and implementing community strategy\\u00a0\\n*   How a systems thinking approach assists in finding high-leverage solutions\\u00a0\\n*   How to facilitate conversations that spark more learning than defensiveness\\u00a0\\n*   How to step into the current mess and create a process of rapid learning\\n*   How these adaptive learning competencies create a collective capacity that leads to insight and system improvement\\n\\n### Developing High-Leverage Strategies\\n\\n**Chris Soderquist**\\n\\nIndividuals and organizations working to improve the public good \\u2013 who are engaged in addressing challenges of sustainability, equity, and health \\u2013 are faced with myriad intractable issues that seem impervious to any efforts to address them. What\\u2019s required is a more holistic, long-term focused approach. This course exposes participants to:\\n\\n*   A systemic process and tools they can use to better identify high-leverage policies and strategies\\n*   Practical techniques (including a multi-question framework and visual tools) that can generate the required learning, especially when used by teams and groups of diverse stakeholders and subject matter experts\\u00a0\\n\\n### Empowerment Evaluation\\n\\n**David Fetterman, PhD**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Courses \\u2014 Claremont Evaluation Center - NY\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cec-ny/programs/courses/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Empowerment Evaluation\\n\\n**David Fetterman, PhD**\\n\\nEmpowerment evaluation builds program capacity and fosters program improvement. It teaches people to help themselves by learning how to evaluate their own programs. Key concepts include: a critical friend, cycles of reflection and action, and a community of learners. Principles guiding empowerment evaluation range from improvement to capacity-building and accountability. The basic steps of empowerment evaluation include: 1) establishing a mission or unifying purpose; 2) taking stock \\u2013 creating a baseline to measure growth and improvement; and 3) planning for the future \\u2013 establishing goals and strategies to achieve objectives, as well as credible evidence to monitor change. A dashboard is used to compare annual goals with quarterly progress. The role of the evaluator is that of a coach or facilitator in an empowerment evaluation, since the group is in charge of the evaluation itself. This course will:\\n\\n*   Introduce participants to the theory, concepts, principles, and steps of empowerment evaluation as well as the technological tools to facilitate the approach\\n*   Highlight how empowerment evaluation produces measurable outcomes with case examples ranging from high-tech companies such as Google and Hewlett-Packard to work in rural Arkansas and squatter settlements in South Africa\\n*   Employing lecture, activities, demonstration and discussion\\n\\n### Ethnography and Qualitative Methods\\n\\n**Michael Quinn Patton, PhD**\\n\\nQuality evaluation requires both qualitative and quantitative methods. Ethnography is a credible and well-established qualitative approach in the social sciences and evaluation. It is the art and science of description. The key, however, is to describe, for example, a classroom, business office, or homeless encampment from the participant\\u2019s world view. Perceptions (of reality) shape behavior. Key concepts guiding the approach include: an emic (or insider) perspective of reality; nonjudgmental orientation; contextualization; holistic orientation; and a cultural perspective. Specific methods concerning data collection include: fieldwork; participant observation; and key informant interviewing. Tools for analysis include: pattern identification; triangulation; and qualitative data analysis software. In addition, the role of a cultural interpretation is described (helping the evaluator distinguish between a \\u201cwink\\u201d and a \\u201cblink\\u201d). Ethics inform much of ethnographic work. Deception is not appropriate or necessary. Ethnography involves extend periods on site, building trust, allowing for patterns to emerge, and thus minimizing \\u201ccompany behavior.\\u201d This course will focus on:\\n\\n*   Ethical discussions: permission, honesty, trust, pseudonyms, and reciprocity\\n*   Ethical dilemmas, including dirty hands and guilty knowledge\\n*   Technological tools of the trade, ranging from online surveys to Google Hangouts\\n\\n### Tech Tools in Evaluation\\n\\n**Tarek Azzam, PhD**\\n\\nTechnology can facilitate and enhance an evaluation. Online surveys, for example, can be used to rapidly poll entire communities with little to no expense. Google Hangouts, FaceTime, and Skype are used for a personal touch, maintaining communication while away from the community or when trying to reach people in remote locations. Google documents, sheets, and slides can be used to encourage collaboration, improving the quality of data collection and reporting.\\n\\nBlogs are used to record ongoing group or community activities, which can be analyzed and used to document community or project progress and dynamics. YouTube can be used as data to analyze videos produced by the community; identifying community concerns, interests, and priorities. They can also be used to build local evaluation capacity. It is a free training tool.\\n\\nInfographics and data visualization are recognized as instrumental tools in evaluation. They contribute to effective communication and impactful reporting.\\n\\nThis workshop will be hands-on and experiential in nature. In addition to the tech tools discussed above, the group will share and experiment with tech tools recommended by workshop participants.\\n\\nOnline Courses\\n--------------\\n\\n### Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Evaluation: What We Need and Why We Don\\u2019t Have It Yet\\n\\n**Deborah Rugg, PhD**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Courses \\u2014 Claremont Evaluation Center - NY\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cec-ny/programs/courses/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Deborah Rugg, PhD**\\n\\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the important and visible role that the agenda assigns to evaluation to inform the agenda\\u2019s follow-up and review process will require efforts to further strengthen evaluation practices in developed and developing countries alike. The aspirational nature and interconnectedness of many of the agenda\\u2019s targets will require those conducting evaluation, as well as those commissioning evaluation, to have a thorough understanding of the agenda and its goals, targets and indicator framework. This workshop will describe the background of the development of the Sustainable Development Goals, why it is unprecedented, some current approaches to \\u201cSDG-responsive evaluation\\u201d and why we have a very long way to go. Consideration of a rights-based approach to performance-based versus systems-based approaches will be highlighted. We will conclude with a discussion of the current status of evaluation as a strategic tool to help achieve the SDGs, and what we now need to do better.\\n\\nParticipants will specifically learn the following:\\n\\n*   What are the SDGs, how did they develop, why are they unprecedented, how did evaluation come to be included, and what are the current challenges?\\n*   How are the SDGs being monitored and evaluated nationally and globally? What are the SDG targets and indicators and how do they relate to evaluation?\\n*   What is SDG-responsive evaluation, and what are some of the different approaches, such as performance-based vs. systems-based approaches?\\n*   What is the status of evaluation in the current global context?

Topics include numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear algebraic equations, algorithmic analysis, computer arithmetic, random number generation, Monte Carlo and optimization methods. The course is also cross-listed as CS 144 at HMC and as Math 264 at CGU.\\n\\n**Background Preparation (Prerequisites)**\\n\\nLinear algebra, ODEs, probability and statistics. Some exposure to the asymptotic analysis of algorithms is assumed (as taught in CS 60, for instance), and some basic background in mathematical analysis will help. Students should have some familiarity with Matlab but can use any standard programming language for computational assignments.\\n\\n**Student Learning Outcomes**\\n\\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\\n\\n*   Understand and apply fundamental techniques of numerical analysis and computational linear algebra\\n*   Understand probabilistic principles behind modeling, simulation, and optimization\\n*   Comfortably, correctly, and confidently use mathematical tools for solving computational problems\\n\\n**Text and References**\\n\\nDetailed course notes, along with a number of other helpful materials, will be posted under the \\u201cFiles\\u201d section on Canvas.

So, I became emotionally numb, which I\\u2019m still now. I\\u2019m still coping up to overcome what I have dealt with\\u2026. I don\\u2019t know from where I got the strength, but I know the Lord is the source. Because we\\u2019ve been taught, whatever teachings have been taught, that has helped me to stand alone with my son. And so this is something that I would want to tell all the single parents, be it a man or a woman, and it is that you need to stand on our own feet and get your education.\\n\\nIf you have a job, do not leave your job. Keep earning, find ways how to earn also, because nowadays, nowadays and always, it is always good to be self-reliant. Because we never know what the future holds for us. Never give up on life\\u2026. Emotionally, I would say, I went through a lot. And even I don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019ve coped up with it. But I think time is the best healer. And always remembering that no matter what, the Lord has your back, always. So these two things.\\n\\nAnd, you know, this thing will probably take some time, more time. I would need to overcome this feeling that I have even right now. Because motherhood has been a joy, but more of it has become a responsibility. So the responsibility part weighs more than the joy as a single parent. So I need to balance that thing out more. But now, I would say, after these five years that I\\u2019ve been on my own, I\\u2019m coming back on living life more happily and looking forward to a bright future.\\n\\n![Image 2: a woman sitting at a table in a log cabin](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2023/01/tamanna-3.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 3: Tamanna Bhatti](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2023/01/tamanna-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 4: a woman and an old man sitting on a couch](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2023/01/tamanna-2.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Tamanna Bhatti - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/bhatti/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: Doman and Baronage of Venafro](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/100915venafro.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/100915venafro.jpg)  \\n_Doman and Baronage of Venafro_\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 1710  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Italy  \\n**Provenience Location:** 1943  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Spoils of war\\n\\n**Nation:** Italy\\n\\n**Location:** Stolen in 1943;

Pengilly Professor of Mathematics at Claremont Graduate University. He joined the university as an associate professor in January 2009.\\n\\nPercus is an applied mathematician whose diverse background has put him at the forefront of a field of mathematics with applications in the computational and physical sciences. His research combines discrete optimization and statistical physics, exploiting physical models and techniques to study the performance of algorithms on NP-hard problems. Together with\\u00a0[Stefan Boettcher](http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/boettcher), he developed the method of\\u00a0[Extremal Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_optimization)\\u00a0that has since been applied to problems ranging from social networks to protein folding.\\n\\nOther research interests include the phase structure of combinatorial problems over ensembles of random instances, using this phase structure to motivate better algorithms and extending the picture to random network models closely reflecting real-world data. Percus has led several interdisciplinary project teams at Los Alamos National Laboratory and has organized numerous conferences and workshops exploring the overlap between combinatorics, phase transitions and computational complexity. His research has received funding from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and Southern California Edison, among others.\\n\\nFrom 2003 to 2006, Percus was associate director of the\\u00a0[Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/)\\u00a0(IPAM) at UCLA, a national institute established by the National Science Foundation to spark interactions between mathematicians and scientists from a broad range of fields. He was responsible for scientific oversight of many of IPAM\\u2019s activities, working in close collaboration with organizing committees across disciplines to create and run programs spreading the impact of mathematics throughout the sciences. He has been\\u00a0an adjunct faculty member in computational science at San Diego State University, a visiting researcher at the New Mexico Consortium, and a visiting associate professor at UCLA.\\n\\nPercus received his BA in Physics from Harvard in 1992 and his PhD from the Universit\\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, in 1997, after which he spent the first part of his scientific career as a technical staff member of Los Alamos National Laboratory\\u2019s Information Sciences Group.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nM.

As an applied psychology program, we sought to conduct meaningful applied research on leaders in organizations. Access for such research was often challenging to gain. At the same time, I kept hearing from my bright and motivated students that they had difficulty finding meaningful work experience.\\u00a0 The culmination of these factors\\u2014the desire to conduct applied research and for my students to gain applied work experience\\u2014drove me to draft the initial strategic plan for LeAD Labs with the input of some of my key students on market conditions and client needs.\\n\\nThe goal of this new organization is to develop leaders in our community and to develop ourselves as practitioners while both using and creating evidence-based leadership assessment and development strategies.\\n\\nIn January of 2013, the Founding members of LeAD Labs met in my home for the first of many strategic planning sessions where we jointly crafted the LeAD Labs mission, vision, values and beliefs about leadership and leader development. Without pay or any incentive beyond building LeAD Labs, the Founding members collected hours and hours of needs assessment data from benchmarking studies of market competitors to client interviews and surveys and an analysis of the research-practice gap. The basis of our findings allowed us to develop a strategic plan, which went through several additional iterations using the balanced scorecard approach and ultimately resulted in our Strategy Map.\\n\\nWho Started LeAD Labs?\\n----------------------\\n\\n![Image 2: Alison_Abercrombie](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2020/01/Alison_Abercrombie.png)\\n\\n**Alison Abercrombie**  \\n\\u201cWe are fortunate to be founding members of an organization that focuses on positive human strengths and psychological capacities in the workplace in order to enhance institutions and society.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 3: Josh-Villanueva](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2020/01/Josh-Villanueva-130px.png)\\n\\n**Josh Villanueva**  \\n_Director of Strategy & Business Development_  \\n\\u201cAs a founding member of LeAD Labs, I have had the opportunity to stoke my entrepreneurial spirit by crafting innovative solutions to longstanding problems in the understanding and practice of leadership development.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 4: Mia-Pennels](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2020/01/Mia-Pennels-130px.png)\\n\\n**Mia Pennels**  \\n\\u201cAs a member of the Strategic Planning Committee, is has truly been an invaluable experience to have a hand in setting the strategic direction of this burgeoning, start-up organization.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 5: Nick-Lamel](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2020/01/Nick-Lamel-130px.png)\\n\\n**Nick Lamel**  \\n\\u201cI have seen first-hand how certain groups find it nearly impossible to gain access to resources to help them grow their leadership and improve their organizations.

Land is vast and people are generally nice, and they help one another. The air is clean, water is fresh, and the food is organic. There can be challenges. When I was a college student in a big city, finding transportation to go home for holidays was difficult, if you couldn\\u2019t afford to fly. The only transportation available was standing in the back of a truck. So, in the summer of 1984, I traveled standing in the back of a truck for about 390 miles on a bumpy dirt road. It took a full day to travel under these conditions. It was difficult experience, but looking back, it taught many lessons.\\n\\nToday, there are many single parent families and a lot of teen moms, more and more women abusing tobacco and alcohol looking for relief. Many are homeless and many suffer mental illnesses. Many children growing up without parental guidance. I believe people should best discover how they can overcome these difficulties and how they can prepare their children for their future. They should also focus on their education. Most of the difficulties stem from family instability. Therefore, children often make the wrong choices during their teens. Our prophets say family is a gift from God. Unfortunately, many people regard their spouse as any other person. In fact, a good spouse is priceless. This is God\\u2019s gift. When it comes to children, we welcome them with abundance of love, and we commit to raising them to be successful.\\n\\nThere are many traditions in our society. I live in a traditional yurt and there are many advantages of living there. Good ventilation of air, and everyone learns to share the living area, and parents ensure quality family time and that is the tradition I try to follow. My mother believed in Buddhism and attended Buddhist temples. When I joined the church, there were worship items of my mother in our home. When missionaries visited, I told them that I use those items in the evenings to connect with mom. The missionaries said I would have to choose between following the practices of Buddhism or following the gospel of Jesus Christ. I chose the latter, however, I still secretly connected with mom in that way. Eventually I donated those items to a Buddhist temple and some to my relatives, who were Buddhist. I didn\\u2019t have conflicting beliefs. It was my way to connect with my mother.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Naranchimeg Tsend - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/tsend/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Eligio Martinez Jr. is a senior research fellow at Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s School of Educational Studies.

In his _The Lost Book of Mormon_, Avi Steinberg, a \\u201cfascinated nonbeliever,\\u201d \\u201dnominates the Mormon scripture as a Great American Novel, or, failing that, as a priceless artifact . . . that deserves our attention.\\u201d In a review of Steinberg\\u2019s book in the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Manseau says the _Book of Mormon_ is \\u201cwithout a doubt one of the most remarkable books ever written.\\u201d And in a recent interview in the New York Times, the author Freeman Dyson, when asked, \\u201cWhat books might we be surprised to find on your bookshelf?\\u201d replied, \\u201c\\u2019_The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ_.\\u2019 I treasure it because . . . \\\\[it\\\\] tells a dramatic story in a fine biblical style. The reader has to wait with growing tension almost until the end of the story to reach the final climax, when Jesus arrives in America and founds his second kingdom here. Literary critic and _Book of Mormon_ scholar Bob Rees discusses some of the stylistic complexities of the _Book of Mormon_, shedding new light on the oft-debated question of how such a remarkable literary creation emerged from nineteenth-century America.\\n\\nRobert A. Rees teaches Mormon Studies at Graduate Theological Union and Religious Studies at UC Berkeley. He is the editor of _Why I Stay: The Challenges of Discipleship for Contemporary Mormons_ and the co-editor of _The Reader\\u2019s Book of Mormon_, both published by Signature Press.\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nShare\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Lecture: Dr. Bob Rees on \\\"Reading the Book of Mormon\\\" - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/dr-bob-rees-reading-the-book-of-mormon/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: a statue of a man and a door](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/04/latchford_2.jpeg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/04/latchford_2.jpeg)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 1100 C.E.  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):** $750,000  \\n**Object Type(s):** Carving, Statue  \\n**Object Material(s):** stone  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Cambodia  \\n**Provenience Location:** Cambodia  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:** 1960-1990\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nOn October 17, 2019, Douglas Latchford, also known as \\u201cPagpong Kriangsak,\\u201d was indicted in the Federal District Court\\u00a0in the Southern District of New York, on five counts, including wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, and smuggling.\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2000  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2019  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Litigation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** United States of America  \\n**Complainant Nation:** United States  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Douglas Latchford a/k/a \\\"Pakpong Kriangsak\\\"  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Private: Individual\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\\n\\nEdited by Tali Maximon\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"3 Cambodian Antiquities and 1 Indian Antiquity \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/3-cambodian-antiquities-1-indian-antiquity/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Founded in 1999, the Quality of Life Research Center (QLRC) studies the field of positive psychology\\u2014including such human strengths as creativity, engagement, intrinsic motivation, and responsibility\\u2014to understand those aspects of human experience that make life worth living. The center was co-founded by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Jeanne Nakamura who is the current director.\\n\\nIn the past, the study of behavior has focused mainly on what goes wrong in human affairs: aggression, mental disease, failure, and hopelessness. Although it is essential to study and address such pathologies, it is equally important to understand those aspects of human experience that make life worth living. The QLRC conducts research on such issues and provides a forum for scholars from the United States and abroad who wish to extend their studies in positive psychology.\\n\\nCGU\\u2019s graduate programs in Positive Psychology were launched in fall 2007 through the School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation, Division of Behavioral & Organizational Sciences, and Department of Psychology. The PhD programs in Positive Organizational Psychology and Positive Developmental Psychology provide research training in positive psychology. MA concentrations in Evaluation and either Positive Organizational Psychology or Positive Developmental Psychology are also offered.\\n\\n##### Research\\n\\nIn response to the dramatic changes in longevity worldwide, the QLRC is pursuing research on social innovation and good work in the second half of life as well as the study of everyday life, using experience sampling methods. Recent research projects have examined how good mentors develop in a variety of professions, supported by a grant from the Spencer Foundation, and studied how well-being is defined in various cultures as part of the cross-national Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation. Other studies underway concern the restoration of a stable society in South American countries recovering from civil war as well improving coaching strategies in professional sports.\\n\\nWith the help of grants from the Fetzer, Ford, Hewlett, Spencer, and Templeton Foundations, the QLRC has conducted research jointly with Harvard and Stanford Universities on the conditions that enable good work in the professions. Areas investigated included business, human genetics, media, philanthropy, and higher education.

Given the recent global economic recession, high unemployment rates, and strident political debates on issues such as deficits, taxation, and economic growth, concerns about money were high on public and personal agendas. From monasticism to communitarianism to prosperity theology, religion has been an important variable in cultural attitudes and ideologies toward participation in the marketplace. For instance, early Mormon leader Brigham Young instructed nineteenth-century Utah Mormons\\u00a0to produce their own food and goods and not to trade with \\u201cgentiles.\\u201d Various Mormon towns experimented with a communitarian system known as the United Order. This separatist stance, however, did not last and throughout the twentieth century, Mormons followed a path of economic integration. With such an example in mind, the conference sought to explore how Mormons have theorized about and used the goods of this world personally, socially, and theologically across time and in various settings.\\n\\nThe first day of the conference featured presentations by Blair Van Dyke (Utah Valley University), \\u00a0Jason M. Brown (Yale University), and David Dixon (Boise State University), followed by a panel discussion on international development. Douglas Anderson (Utah State University) delivered the keynote address on the Mormon brand.

In 1870, the Mormon-governed Utah Territory granted women the right to vote, 50 years before the 19th amendment guaranteed that right to women nationwide. However, the church's opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and excommunication of vocal feminists in the 1990s were seen by many as steps backward for equality. This is the history that fuels the research and advocacy of School of Religion student Caroline Kline, who proudly calls herself a Mormon and a feminist.\\n\\nKline is working with CGU faculty member Claudia Bushman on an ambitious oral-history project that aims to capture the reality of being a Mormon woman. The goal is to conduct a series of two-hour interviews with 100 Mormon women to record their personal backgrounds, their thoughts on Latter-day Saints' women's issues, and their experiences within the Mormon Church. Kline sees this as a unique resource for future historians.\\n\\n\\\"The story of the Mormon Church has been enormously dominated by men,\\\" she noted. \\\"Women have so often been the silent majority throughout the church's history. Hopefully, what we've put together will be a treasure trove of information on the lives of Mormon women, in all their diversity, in the twentieth century.\\\"\\n\\nThrough conducting and transcribing interviews, Kline is learning about aspects of her faith rarely addressed at a Sunday service. \\\"There are so many fascinating stories. Women's experiences with fertility are interesting - especially decisions about birth control. There are stories about resisting leadership, which interest me a great deal,\\\" Kline said. \\\"But the stories are largely positive. Most of the devout women we interviewed had very good experiences within their congregations. Mormonism has given shape and meaning to their lives.\\\"\\n\\nSupplementing this research, Kline credits her course work at CGU with giving her an expansive view of religion that provides peace of mind as well as insight: \\\"I'm much less filled with angst than I used to be. Now, if someone says something in church that disagrees with my worldview, I step back and say, \\u2018Well isn't that interesting? Why would they think that?' I tend to take a much more analytical point of view.\\\"\\n\\nKline has also co-founded a blog for progressive Mormon women, the Exponent ([www.the-exponent.com](http://www.the-exponent.com/)). Somewhat surprisingly, blogging has played a key role in advancing Mormon feminism. In the past, publishing criticisms of the church could be considered a provocative act potentially resulting in excommunication. Writing on the Internet, however, is less risky, largely due to the sheer volume of posts and the potential for anonymity; bloggers frequently use only first names or pseudonyms (though Kline has chosen to disclose her full name and publish her photo). These conditions have created much more expansive dialogue between and amongst Mormon women, including The Exponent's 20 regular contributors. \\\"The goal is to give women a forum to talk about their experiences,\\\" said Kline. \\\"Their triumphs, their pain, what they want to see changed, what works, what doesn't.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition, Kline is involved in what she considers the next wave of Mormon feminism: activism. In fall 2010 she became a founding board member of WAVE (Women Advocating for Voice and Equality). Among other projects, the group will be issuing collective calls to action advocating for increased participation for women in LDS church meetings. Though she has been frustrated in the past, Kline is hopeful for the future: \\\"One of the strengths of Mormonism is its ability to evolve,\\\" she said. \\\"Mormonism in principle has a dynamic and changing canon. Because we have this idea of continuing revelation, there is a possibility for change. Our leaders just have to be open to the inspiration. There's always hope.\\\"\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Shine a Light | Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"http://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/your-lasting-impact/shine-a-light\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Information contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

She also points to the social inequality that Nigerian women confront, saying that men do not consider women their equals in Nigeria. She thinks that far too often, husbands don\\u2019t treat wives as equal partners and don\\u2019t respect their opinions. This dynamic is present in many Latter-day Saint marriages in Nigeria, she reports, and she finds that too often women are taught to be submissive to their husbands in Relief Society classes.\\n\\nDaramola loves the teachings of the Church, the community, and the skills she has been taught through the Church. Particularly important to her are the concepts of agency, personal revelation, and a benevolent God who knows her personally.

She is a developmental psychologist interested in understanding and supporting the positive development and moral growth of young people. Most recently, she has investigated these topics through the lens of young people\\u2019s purposes in life.\\n\\nWork in her [Adolescent Moral Development lab](https://www.kendallcottonbronk.com/) has focused on addressing two primary questions around purpose. First, what does purpose look like among diverse groups of young people, including youth growing up in poorly resourced communities, youth growing up in developing countries, and youth growing up amidst global economic challenges? Second, work in her lab has focused on creating and testing strategies for fostering purpose among youth. Resulting purpose-fostering tools have been shared with thousands of youth across the country.\\n\\nCurrent research in the lab is focused on family purpose, purpose among adolescent and young adult cancer survivors, and purpose among street children in Liberia. Her work has been funded by the Spencer Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, and the Fulbright Foundation.\\n\\nIn addition to her substantive interests, Bronk has also helped define and outline the parameters of the exemplar methodology, an approach to empirical research that provides insight into exemplary, or highly developed, forms of growth. Understanding not only what is common but also what is possible is critical to a complete understanding of human development and flourishing. Bronk teaches master\\u2019s and doctoral classes on positive contexts, child development, adolescent development, and qualitative research methods. She also teaches a directed research course for first-year positive developmental doctoral students.\\n\\nAfter graduating with a BS from Northwestern University, Bronk earned her doctorate from Stanford University and completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at the Stanford Center on Adolescence.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nCo-authored with Reichard, R.

Known to many as the \\u201cfather of flow\\u201d\\u2014a term he coined to refer to the psychological state of optimal performance\\u2014Csikszentmihalyi was a researcher, educator, public speaker, and co-director of the university\\u2019s Quality of Life Research Center.\\n\\n### _**He devoted his life to finding an answer to a simple question: What constitutes a happy life?**_\\n\\nAffectionately known on the CGU campus as \\u201cMike C,\\u201d Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\\u2014with Professor Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania\\u2014saw something lacking in psychology\\u2019s areas of study. So they set out to develop a focus on happiness, well-being, and positivity with a goal to create a field focused on human well-being and the conditions that enable people to flourish and live satisfying lives.\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi\\u2019s work with Seligman was preceded by his growing international reputation as the author, in 1990, of _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience._ A bestseller translated into more than 20 languages, the book\\u2019s many admirers include business leaders, President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Dallas Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson who, following the team\\u2019s 1993 Super Bowl victory, said of _Flow_ that \\u201cmy team has won because of this book.\\u201d\\n\\n### **Ideas & Interests**\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi\\u2019s interest in what he later identified as\\u201cflow\\u201d started during his graduate years at the University of Chicago. He recalled in an interview how he would watch painters in their studios and how he was fascinated by their ability to forget everything while working. He was also surprised by what happened when they were done:\\n\\n**_They\\u2019d finish a work of art, and instead of enjoying it\\u2026they would put it against the wall and start a new painting. They weren\\u2019t really interested in the finished painting._**\\n\\nWhat these artists were after, Csikszentmihalyi realized, wasn\\u2019t the finished work itself but the experience of full immersion and absorption in the act of creation.\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi went on to study how people attained this state, and in his early work he focused on athletes and artists. He soon discovered that this quality he referred to as \\u201cflow\\u201d applied to people in many different pursuits, whether they were rock climbers, basketball and hockey players, dancers, composers, or chess masters.\\n\\n### **Publications & Awards**\\n\\nUnderlying much of Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s pioneering work was his innovative and groundbreaking use of pagers and questionnaires to produce a database based on people\\u2019s self-reports of their ordinary experiences.\\n\\nWhile _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience_\\u00a0became a bestseller in 1990 and presented his conclusions based on that database in a warm, humanistic prose style, his other books\\u2014_The Evolving Self_\\u00a0(1993),\\u00a0_Creativity_\\u00a0(1996), and\\u00a0_Good Business_\\u00a0(2003)\\u2014expanded on his theories in a variety of directions.\\n\\nBecause Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s approach generated a cross-section of daily experience, his analysis paid more attention to experiences of positive states\\u2013like enjoyment or creativity\\u2013than many of his predecessors. That work formed the theoretical background of his collaboration with Seligman.\\n\\nTogether, in 2000, they published an influential article in\\u00a0_American Psychologist_, the flagship journal of the American Psychological Association, that introduced the profession to positive psychology. That work was recognized with Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s appointment as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and his selection for the 2009 Clifton Strengths Prize and the 2011 Sz\\u00e9chenyi Prize.\\n\\nOther awards and distinctions include his receipt, in 2014, of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary.\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi also has enjoyed a robust following online. Since the first appearance of his 2004 TED Talk, \\u201cFlow, the secret to happiness,\\u201d it has received some 6,693,254 views.\\n\\n### **Lessons & Legacy**\\n\\nWith his arrival at CGU in 1999, Csikszentmihalyi founded the Quality of Life Research Center (QLRC) with colleague and co-director Jeanne Nakamura.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi \\u00b7 The Father of Flow\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/people/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"One result of Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s work with\\u00a0Seligman on positive psychology was to create several research centers across the country that would focus on the principles of this fledgling field.

Pengilly Professor of Mathematics at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at Claremont Graduate University, a member of the [Claremont Colleges](http://www.claremont.edu/). From 2003 to 2006, he was Associate Director of the [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) (IPAM) at UCLA, a national institute established by the NSF to spark interactions between mathematicians and scientists from a broad range of fields. He was responsible for scientific oversight of many of IPAM\\u2019s activities, working in close collaboration with organizing committees across disciplines to create and run programs spreading the impact of mathematics throughout the sciences.\\n\\nDr. Percus received his B.A. in physics from Harvard in 1992 and his Ph.D. from the Universit\\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay in 1997, following which he spent the first part of his scientific career at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His research has combined discrete optimization and statistical physics, exploiting physical models and techniques to study the performance of algorithms on NP-hard problems. Together with [Stefan Boettcher](http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/boettcher), he developed the method of [Extremal Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_optimization) that has since been applied to problems ranging from social networks to protein folding. Other research interests include the phase structure of combinatorial problems over ensembles of random instances, using this phase structure to motivate better algorithms and extending the picture to random network models closely reflecting real-world data. Dr. Percus has led several interdisciplinary project teams at Los Alamos, and has organized numerous conferences and workshops exploring the overlap between combinatorics, phase transitions and computational complexity.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Allon Percus\", \"source\": \"https://scholar.cgu.edu/allon-percus\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Whether you\\u2019re entering graduate school a polished or novice writer, Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s [Center for Writing & Rhetoric](https://mycampus.cgu.edu/web/writing-rhetoric) is committed to helping you achieve the next level of excellence in the written word.

The goal was to use these robots to collect data in the Arctic and Antarctic, places too dangerous for humans to visit.\\n\\nThe project required testing in the field, and Howard recalls what it was like being helicoptered to a remote glacier to see the robots in action.

Looking at 17 Latin American countries, we observe that there is strong variation in the presence of states across their territories, and that a state\\u2019s level of presence has consequences for the socioeconomic characteristics of the country. We also observe that in countries with high variation of subnational state capacity\\u2014that is, a state\\u2019s military, administrative, and institutional capabilities to effectively govern its territories and provide services to their citizens\\u2014social policies are not uniformly executed across territories. Accordingly, the effectiveness of such policies vary. And more so, depending on the level of territorial development where the policies are executed. Our analysis of the data shows that these dynamics have consequences for the levels of income inequality\\u2014which in turn exacerbate the differences in development between regions.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBackground  \\nThis report focuses on Latin America, a region for a long time characterized by very high levels of income inequality. In Latin America, political and economic elites established\\u2014since Spanish and Portuguese colonialism in the 15th century\\u2014an inefficient structure of goods and services allocation that has prevented fair redistribution across subnational regions. Such inefficiency led to the configuration of weak states that are not able to effectively distribute public goods and services to the poor and invest little in the geographic areas with low state presence (but where the resources are most needed).\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Policy Briefs \\u2014 Institute for Democratic Renewal\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/iprc/policy-briefs/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Whereas state penetration allows redistributing more in certain areas of the country, there are other areas isolated from the presence of the state where access to public goods and transfers are not possible. The absence of state presence impinges, in turn, the strengthen on governmental institutions, challenging to identify and take care of the needs of the population, extract resources, provide public goods and services, and redistribute resources appropriately. As the state presence is weaker in these areas, their population becomes less relevant in political terms (for example showing lower voter turnout and trust), further decreasing the interest of the government to deliver any type of public good or service to redistribute.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAnalysis  \\nWe based our analysis on data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latin America Population Surveys from Vanderbilt University, and a series of surveys implemented by Luna and Soifer (2017)\\u2014which includes a set of questions that measure the territorial influence that the central state has across a country.  \\nOur analysis shows a positive correlation between state capacity and income inequality, with a positive yet small coefficient on a model that regresses net income inequality on state capacity (proxied with the Myers score ), controlling for time and subnational factors (Figure 1). Results also show a positive relationship between territorial reach of the state and public goods provision (proxied with access to piped water and sewage system) (Figure 2). We also find a negative effect of a region\\u2019s distance to the capital on national income inequality (proxied with the Gini coefficient) (Figure 3). The results represented in the three figures suggest that higher levels of state capacity (in terms of provision of services and territorial reach) reduce inequality at the subnational level.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nConclusion  \\nIn this brief report the relationship between state capacity and inequality has been discussed. The conducted analysis on 17 Latin American countries shows that high levels of state capacity reduce inequality at the subnational level. When central states have the ability to provide welfare services, inequality across different regions of a country and different social classes tends to be lower. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the more local communities are far from the capital, the higher inequality tends to be in those communities, denoting difficulties (in this case in developing countries) for central states to fairly redistribute goods and services in all regions.\\n\\n![Image 3: a graph showing the relationship between the price of a product and the price of a product](https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/12/Figure-3-300x218.jpg) ![Image 4: two graphs showing the quality of a product](http://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/12/Figure-4-300x218.jpg) ![Image 5: a graph showing the distance between two points](http://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/12/Figure-5-300x218.jpg)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nVienne Wing-yan Lau, PhD candidate, CGU  \\nThe 2020 IPRC Best Policy Brief Award\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nThe present study demonstrates that self-interest may be utilized to motivate men to support gender inclusion initiatives in the workplace.

To combat these challenges, many organizations and governments have been working to implement an array of initiatives and policies to promote women\\u2019s rights. Yet, this type of organizational intervention often yields mixed results (Kossek, Su, & Wu, 2017; Woetzel, 2015). The failure of these programs has been partly attributed to the inability to mobilize men to support this cause (Grant, 2014; Sherf, Tangirala, & Weber, 2017). The current framing of gender issues seems to widen the divide between men and women and is not likely to unite them to pursue the goal of gender equality together. To realize gender equality in the workplace, change efforts ought to encourage men to recognize their stake in the issue rather than highlighting their \\u2018contribution\\u2019 to the problem or excluding them altogether. In the present study, I use self-interest theory as a guiding framework to attempt to increase men\\u2019s support for gender inclusion initiatives in the workplace.\\n\\nData and Methods\\n\\nSelf-interest is related to costs and benefits regarding a particular subject (Bolino & Grant, 2015). One might have a high self-interest in a policy, for example, if they are immediately and personally affected by it (Liberman & Chaiken, 1996). Guiding by the purpose of this study, I derive three hypotheses.\\n\\nFirst, I hypothesize that men would be more likely to support gender inclusion initiatives when framed as appealing to self-interest compared to when framed as appealing to other-interest only (Hypothesis 1). Social dominance orientation (SDO) refers to one\\u2019s preference for ingroup domination and superiority over outgroups (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994). Second, I hypothesize that SDO would moderate the relationship between framing and support for gender inclusion initiatives such that this relationship would be weaker among individuals with a high SDO (Hypothesis 2). Third, the moderating effect of SDO would be attenuated by champion gender, such that high SDO men would display more support for gender inclusion initiatives when the champion is male compared to when the champion is female (Hypothesis 3).\\n\\nI employ a 2 (Framing: Self-interest, Other-interest only) x 2 (Champion gender: Male, Female) factorial between-subject experimental study to test the hypotheses set forth. I recruited 267 full-time, male employees from Mechanical Turk. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: Self-interest X male champion (_n =_ 73), Self-interest X female champion (_n =_ 67), Other-interest only X male champion (_n =_ 67), and Other-interest only X female champion (_n =_ 60). Participants were presented with a corporate communication video announcing the gender inclusion initiative. Those in the self-interest conditions learned that men would also benefit from the initiative but those in the other-interest only conditions were informed that men would not benefit from it. Those in the male champion conditions would see a male champion in the video and those in the female champion conditions would see a female champion in the video. After this, participants answered questions about manipulation check, support for the gender inclusion initiative, and SDO. Support for the gender inclusion was operationalized as attitudes toward the gender inclusion initiative, which were assessed with seven 7-point semantic differential items (Osgood, 1952; Siegel, Navarro, Tan, & Hyde, 2014). SDO was measured with the 8-item SDO7 Short Scale developed by Ho et al. (2015, \\u03b1 = .90).\\n\\nPlease note that with the absence of a control group in the current study, the findings are subject to threats to internal validity. Further research is needed to establish causal inference and directionality of the relationship.\\n\\nResults and Discussion\\n\\nThe results show that self-interest is an effective way to garner men\\u2019s support for a gender inclusion initiative in organizations. Those who learn that the initiative would benefit both men and women were more likely to support the initiative compared to those who learned that it will only benefit others (see Figure 1); this was especially true among individuals with a low SDO. Having a male champion for the gender inclusion initiative, however, helps attenuate individuals with high SDO\\u2019s unfavorable attitudes toward the gender inclusion initiative.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Policy Briefs \\u2014 Institute for Democratic Renewal\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/iprc/policy-briefs/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Altogether, it should be clear to policymakers that an inclusive approach needs to be adopted in creating an inclusive workplace.

Second, policymakers should identify powerful men who can serve as role models and allies for gender equality to inculcate a top-down change for their organizations. Third, it would be impactful if policymakers can identify potential male allies at different echelons and provide them with resources to instill bottom-up change. These can serve as the critical steps to cultivate a culture that supports the sustainability of a gender equality initiative (Cummings & Worley, 2014).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this study, I test an inclusive approach to gender equality through reframing the issue to appeal to men\\u2019s self-interest.

The causes of youth suicide are complex and multifaceted. Existing research shows that adolescents are susceptible to socio-economic factors and incur stressors from school closures, disrupted routines, social isolation, family economic hardships, and social hardships (Mayne et al., 2021). Other important causes of suicide among adolescents include academic expectation pressures, bullying (physical and online), physical, psychological and sexual abuse, substance abuse, and sexual identity (Edwards et al., 2021; Hochhauser et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2019; Kreski et al., 2021; Schwartz et al. 2019; Wasserman et al., 2020; Whitmore et al, 2019; Yildiz et al, 2019).\\n\\nRecent Trends\\n\\nSuicide, suicide ideation, and attempts have been on the rise for adolescents in San Bernardino County. The data shows that youth suicide rate in the county reached 3.5 per 100,000 in 2017, while remaining slightly lower than the state average. The local government offers mental health services for population, but there are gaps in access and services associated with language, cultural, or gender identity barriers; the stigma of seeking help; and knowledge of the availability of services (Hochhauser et al., 2020; San Bernardino County, 2019). For instance, in 2017, the county provided mental health services to 45,400 people as compared to 68,300 of the estimated poverty-level residents in need of mental health services.\\n\\n![Image 7: suicide rate trends in bernardine county, 2020](https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/09/Picture1-v.2-300x270.png)\\n\\n![Image 8: suicide rate by age in california](https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/09/Picture2-300x267.png)![Image 9: unemployed court clients served public residents in need of mental health services](http://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/09/Picture3-v.3-284x300.jpg)\\n\\nRole of K-12 schools in Youth Suicide Prevention\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Policy Briefs \\u2014 Institute for Democratic Renewal\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/iprc/policy-briefs/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Role of K-12 schools in Youth Suicide Prevention\\n\\nLearning activities and lesson plans raise awareness and understanding of social and physical support for suicide prevention.

She was brought up in the Zion Christian Church, but felt unsatisfied with it. When she was eighteen missionaries knocked on her door and introduced her to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Compelled by the Book of Mormon and the Plan of Salvation, she joined the Church at nineteen. She loved Institute and ultimately decided to serve a mission at twenty-one. She was the first sister missionary from Botswana and served her mission in the South Africa Durban mission. Kenewang now works in a hospital in the semi-urban village of Serowe under the Clinical Services (blood donation) Department.\\n\\nOne challenge Kenewang has faced is navigating her life as a single childless woman in Botswana, where there is widespread expectation for women to become mothers, whether in or outside of wedlock. While that has been difficult, she feels the church has given her many opportunities to develop. She has taught Institute for several years and was Botswana\\u2019s first Relief Society president of a Young Single Adult ward. As Relief Society president, Kenewang worked closely with young women in her ward.\\n\\nKenewang names the Church Educational System as a major influence in her life, as it has built her into the woman she is today. She says, \\u201cI have been able to achieve great things, both temporal and spiritual blessings, because of its nurturing and tutoring. I have felt fully armored with confidence to do anything. I have been able to use this confidence \\u2026 in job interviews, empathy, relating to people, and the fact that I am able to strike up a conversation with a stranger down a street corner in a bus or anywhere without any fear.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 2: Kenewang Mbisana ](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2019/11/kay-face.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Kenewang Mbisana - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/mbisana/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: a piece of paper with several pieces of paper hanging from it](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/Magnusson-MS.jpeg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/Magnusson-MS.jpeg)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** Various  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):** Book, Manuscript, Music Score  \\n**Object Material(s):** animal product, ink or dye, paper, vellum  \\n**Provenience Nation:**  \\n**Provenience Location:** Various  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:**\\n\\n**Nation:** Iceland\\n\\n**Location:** Denmark\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\n3,000 Manuscripts, saga texts and historical documents - Arnamagn\\u00e6an Manuscript Collection: Manuscripts, Saga Texts and Historical Documents\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 1830  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 1997  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Private Negotiation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Government  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Iceland  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Government  \\n**Respondent Nation:** Denmark  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Icelandic Arnamagn\\u00e6an Manuscript Collection \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/arnamagnaean-manusccript-collection/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"If you have already made a gift to Claremont Graduate University, please let us know.

This has increased the traditional tensions between individual freedom and social responsibility to a point where the binding forces of our societies seem to be exhausted. Where previously the commonalities of nature, culture, and tradition that connect us before we become an individual self were emphasized, we have learned to deconstruct these commonalities and replace them with our own cultural constructions without being disturbed by the biological, cultural, moral or religious limitations of earlier times. However, instead of creating a society of equals, for which many have hoped, we have increased inequality, diversity, and injustice in our societies to an unprecedented degree. In order to create more just conditions for everybody, we pursue politics that promote greater self-determination, cultural participation, and political power for marginalized groups in order to help them assert their distinctiveness and gain recognition in contexts of real or perceived inequality or injustice. But we often do it without due regard for the interests and potentials of society at large, or the different needs of others, or the commonalities we must share for our society to work. Like the sorcerer\\u2019s apprentice, we have inaugurated a global process of social change but cannot control the forces that drive us apart or prevent the weakening of the forces that bind us together.\\n\\nThe tensions between centripetal and centrifugal forces in society can be observed everywhere, and they have been fueled by the global spread of capitalism and consumerism. For some freedom, independence and autonomy are the highest values in our society that must not be compromised by any social commitments, legal restrictions or political obligations. Others emphasize justice, equity, and equality and insist that we must practice solidarity with those who need it and assume responsibility even for that for which we are not responsible. But why play off one against the other? Is it true that insistence on autonomy and diversity weakens social cohesion, or that striving for justice, equity and equality undermines individual freedom? How much individuality and what kinds of diversity are we ready to accept? Where do we want to draw a line, if we do, and for which reasons? How much autonomy and diversity are possible without destroying social cohesion and human solidarity? And how much social commonality is necessary to be able to live an autonomous life and do justice to diversity?\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2020 Autonomy, Diversity and the Common Good \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/2020-autonomy-diversity-and-the-common-good/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"A long tradition has seen the common good as the social order in which individuals and groups can best strive for perfection.

But what does \\u2018perfection\\u2018 mean today? And what has become of the common good in our time? There are significant differences between conceptions of the common good in the West and East and between secular and religious interpretations of the human pursuit of happiness and fulfilled life. What are the contributions to this debate by religious traditions? How do they configure the ideas of autonomy, diversity, and the common good? Do they have anything to offer that goes beyond secular conceptions? If so, is what they offer compatible with secular views? Or must we depart from the idea of the common good and seek alternatives that would allow us to better hold together the diverging forces of autonomy, individuality, and diversity on the one hand and the binding forces of social justice, equality, solidarity, and responsibility on the other?\\n\\nThese are some of the questions to be discussed at the 41st Annual Philosophy of Religion Conference at Claremont.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2020 Autonomy, Diversity and the Common Good \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/2020-autonomy-diversity-and-the-common-good/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: a box with a lot of paper in it sitting on a table](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/12/Marble-fragment-Rome.jpeg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/12/Marble-fragment-Rome.jpeg)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:**  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):** Building  \\n**Object Material(s):** marble, stone  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Italy  \\n**Provenience Location:** Roman Forum  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:** 2017\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nlarge fragment of marble sent to the National Roman Museum via parcel with a note attached containing an apology Marble was marked \\\"To Sam\\\" and a heart with \\\"Jess\\\" and \\\"Rome 2017\\\"\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2017  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2020  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Sua sponte donation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** National Roman Museum  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Italy  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Private: Institution\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** American tourist  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Private: Individual\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\\n\\nMuseum has not released any specifics regarding the marble fragment.

To understand ethical and moral decisions by managers across all levels, academics have been and are conducting research on _ethical leadership_ and provide both theoretical and practical suggestions. Ethical leadership, which is defined as \\u201cthe demonstration of _normatively appropriate conduct_ through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement, and decision-making\\u201d, is reported to promote positive organizational outcomes including promotion of corporate ethical culture and corporate social responsibility activities. Especially, since those in the upper levels in the corporate\\u2019s hierarchy tend to exert greater influence on corporate culture and outcomes than those in the lower levels, ethical leadership is considered an important virtue for top executives in business.\\n\\nHowever, there is one important issue in ethical leadership which is not fully discussed in the business context: what does \\u201cethical\\u201d mean in ethical leadership? Or, in terms of the definition provided above, what is \\u201cnormatively appropriate conduct?\\u201d If there are contrasting theories of ethics, under any controversial situation it is possible that one may not conclude a leader\\u2019s action solely as ethical or unethical. In fact, not only CEOs and top executives, but also lower level managers and lay people often face situations requiring decision making where different ethics theories support different actions. Historically, from the ancient Greek period, the topic of ethics has been discussed. In application to business contexts, scholars suggest various methods to measure both business ethics and ethical leadership. Among them, there is an approach using fictional situations. In each scenario, respondents take the role of the manager in charge of the situation and are asked to make decision based on his or her own ethical guideline. After that, each respondent is asked to state the reason behind their decisions. In the remaining of this post, I will first introduce three important ethical perspectives, namely _deontological_, _consequential_, and _virtue-based_ perspective, respectively. And then, I will provide an example of hypothetical scenario and describe different ethical actions on the situation based on different ethics theories.\\n\\nKantian Ethics vs. Utilitarian Ethics\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nIn terms of business ethics, among the various ethical theories in philosophy, two major theories are frequently compared and contrasted: deontology or Kantian approach, and consequentialism or Utilitarian approach. Based on deontological account, the morality of an action is based on whether the action adheres to a rule or rules. It does not concern the outcome of an action at all, therefore an action can be judged as either right or wrong by its adherence to rules. For example, lying in terms of deontological ethics is always wrong regardless of any potential benefit(s) that might come from lying. In contrast, based on consequential account, the rightness or wrongness of an action is judged by the consequences of one\\u2019s conduct. From this account, for example, lying can become either a right action or a wrong action based on its final consequence. Traditionally, in the business context, both scholars and practitioners have approached morality issue from either deontology or consequentialism. However, a third approach, namely virtue-based ethics or Aristotelian ethics, is getting more and more attention recently, especially among the scholars who conduct research on ethical _leadership_. According to Aristotle and other virtue-based ethics proponents, the character of the agent rather than the nature or consequences of the act itself should matter when judging the rightness or wrongness of an action. In terms of lying, virtue scholars would focus less on lying in any particular instance and instead consider the character of the liar. As such, the morality of lying would be determined on a case-by-case basis, which would be based on factors such as personal benefit, group benefit, and intentions (as to whether they are benevolent or malevolent).\\n\\nNow, let\\u2019s move onto an exercise.

From deontological perspective, bribe is illegal, against company policy, or not right in itself. Therefore, the only answer in this situation is \\u201cno\\u201d to the deontologists. In contrast, to consequentialist, if the bribing will surely lead to the increased revenue and is considered in the Asian country as a \\u201ccustom\\u201d, this will benefit both the company and the businessman requesting bribe, resulting in bribing as an ethical action. From virtue-based accounts, the judgment of the action differs case by case. However, while the consequentialists focus on the final outcome of the action, virtue ethics emphasize the character of the decision maker. If the decision maker is considered as a reliable and moral person and the decision is based on his or her own ethical guideline, be it deontology, consequentialism, or another perspective, then the manager\\u2019s action becomes ethical regardless of whether he or she bribes or not.\\n\\nAs I have shown in the example above, sometimes there exists no single \\u201cmoral\\u201d or \\u201cethical\\u201d action in business context. Therefore, when we need to make any ethical decision, it will be important to acknowledge that there exists diverse perspectives on ethics and it is possible that one action can be considered as \\u201cethical\\u201d by one party but as \\u201cunethical\\u201d by another.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n_[Shin Han](http://www.leadlabs.org/about-lead/lead-team-members-2/shin-han/) is a doctoral student in positive organizational psychology at Claremont Graduate University and works as a research associate in LeAD labs.

You\\u2019ll receive reliable, predictable payments for your lifetime (and the lifetime of a loved one, if you choose).\\n\\n### For Example\\n\\nBarbara, 72, transfers $25,000 in exchange for a charitable gift annuity.

You will receive a federal income tax charitable deduction (when you itemize) in the year the gift is made and eliminate part of the capital gains tax you would have paid if selling the securities. And if you have stocks that produce low-yield dividends, you may be able to increase your income.\\n\\n### Give From Your IRA\\n\\nIf you are 70\\u00bd or older, you can make a one-time election for a qualified charitable distribution of up to $53,000 (without being taxed) from your IRA to fund a gift annuity.

When great evil is done to human beings, we may feel that something absolute has been violated. Can that sense, which is related to gratitude for existence, be expressed without religious concepts? Can we express central religious concerns, such as losing the self, while abandoning any religious metaphysic? Is moral obligation itself dependent on divine commands if it is to be objective, or is morality not only independent of religion, but its accuser if God is said to allow horrendous evils? In any case, what happens to the absolute claims of religion in what is, undeniably, a morally pluralistic world? These are the central questions discussed by philosophers of religion and moral philosophers in this collection. They do so in ways which bring new aspects to bear on these traditional issues.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"1994 Religion and Morality \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/1994-religion-morality/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Book cover - The Concise Oxford Companion to American Literature](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-book-Martin-v2.jpg)\\n\\nIn true and definitive CGU collaborative fashion, Professor of American Literature and American Studies **Wendy Martin** and **Danielle Hinrichs (PhD, English, 2005)** worked together to update the newest edition of _The Concise Oxford Companion to American Literature_.\\n\\nThe original 1986 edition was edited by James D.

The possibility of applying interpolation techniques to approximation theory was initiated by Jaak Peetre in 1963. The main realization starts with recognizing that under some mild conditions (namely the inequalities of Jackson and Bernstein are satisfied), every approximation space is a real interpolation space. This means that the K-method of real interpolation theory becomes available as a tool in approximation theory, which can then be used to obtain, for example, Bernstein and Jackson theorems concerning the best approximation of functions in $L\\\\_{p}(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by entire functions of exponential type, approximation of compact operators by operators of finite rank, approximation of differential operators by difference operators.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nAsuman Aksoy (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Image 6: David Kogan](https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2021/12/David-Kogan-150px.png)\\n\\n##### Title of PhD Thesis\\n\\n**On the Average Coherence of Lattices**  \\nCoherence is a measure of non-orthogonality in signal processing. Recently, my advisor applied this concept to lattices. The reason for this is that some other measures of non-orthogonality are directly linked to lattice packing density, an important research question in many applied fields. A related measure of non-orthogonality is average coherence, which we introduce to lattices for the first time. Additionally, we investigate various geometric properties of several different important classes of arithmetic lattices with a general view towards maximal and average coherence, as well as some related parameters.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nLenny Fukshansky (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Image 7: Sina Zareian](https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2021/12/Sina-Zareian-150px.png)\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Title\\n\\n**Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution of the Traffic Flow Partial Differential Equation on Multi-Lane Freeways**  \\nIn mathematics and transportation engineering, traffic flow is the study of interactions between travellers (drivers, and their vehicles) and infrastructure (including highways and traffic control devices), with the aim of understanding and developing an optimal transport network with efficient movement of traffic and minimal traffic congestion problems.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nHenry Schellhorn (CGU)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### **Preston D.

Further, there are also known algorithms for quadratic polynomials. An important approach to the problem of finding such algorithms over rings and fields of arithmetic interest for different classes of polynomials is through the use of search bounds with respect to height, a standard measure of arithmetic complexity. We study the existence of search bounds on height of solutions for large classes of multilinear polynomials.

Through my current residency at The Mystery Ranch, I expanded my practice to include film photography with antique cameras. In 2019, I received a grant to attend a sculpture workshop in Montana where I learned new techniques to push my forging practice. That same year, my Reclaimed Stories series was shown in Peoria Illinois as part of a citywide celebration of female identified artists working in steel. In 2020 I entered the MFA program at CGU where I am refining my artistic language and goals.\\n\\nI also continue to work at my shop in Santa Ana, where I create commissioned pieces and develop my sculptures.

A new marriage, schools, move and jobs. We got to know a handful of people in our ward casually and then church completely shut down. As a mixed faith family we have now gone close to a year with no sacrament. No ministering home or visiting teachers. No young men leaders reaching out.\\n\\nNo relief society or elders quorum reaching out. The bishop contacted us once. After we contacted him to inquire if anything could be done to support our son who was struggling with disconnect and depression. Empty promises were made and he said he would have his young men\\u2019s leaders reach out and support him.\\n\\nThey never did.\\n\\nWe asked if it was possible to have the sacrament brought to our house. No one showed.\\n\\nWe did get lots of emails and texts about signing up for tithing settlement.\\n\\nIt has left us thinking. Is this church really for mixed faith families anymore? Single parent families? Blended culture or race families? I feel like it\\u2019s not. COVID to me accentuated a large and growing crack within the church. According to statistics close to 40% of our church households do not contain a priesthood holder within its walls.\\n\\nTo us that aspect alone has been surprising to not see better addressed during covid. I fear Christ himself is probably concerned with the state of his church. For Easter last year my former catholic priest asked for food drive donations. On Easter morning instead of online services, people dropped off food safely from their cars while he chatted individually with each member and blessed them for their service and sacrifice Easter Sunday morning. He\\u2019s freed up time in his week to sit outside and have people drive up and visit, do confessions or take sacrament. Those who can\\u2019t come he visits safely on their porch and delivers it to them. You talk of Christ? He is the exact image of what Christ would exemplify and exactly what Christ would be doing. Since I grew up catholic I often get newsletter emails and mailings and am thrilled to see that the parish has participated in many trunk lunch bible study activities and youth service activities during covid that served different populations and demographics of the community and the parish.\\n\\n![Image 1: window view alone](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/03/window-view-1081788_1920.jpg)\\n\\nMaybe our last few wards have just been bad apples. I\\u2019ve faithfully visited those I minister to, sign up when possible for any service activities we see come across during covid but I don\\u2019t believe those who helped to restore this gospel ignored close to 40% of their church. That\\u2019s exactly why this church is so different from others. The very institution of wards helped to establish and maintain a way to care for others needs and administer more efficiently to those requiring it.\\n\\nI struggle each week to hear long time member after long time member of our ward say how wonderful of a ward we have. It is nails on a chalkboard when you have children suffering. When you can\\u2019t get them to turn on zoom to attend a youth class because of depression and feeling like no one cares about them.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve decided we may not be in Christ\\u2019s church anymore\\u2026or at least Christ\\u2019s ward. We will continue to serve and love others as we have been through the pandemic. We will keep our arms outstretched to our ward but cautiously. We know the spirit hasn\\u2019t left us.

Instead, it had to do with her professional network.\\n\\nThat was the one thing that couldn\\u2019t move with her. Most of Gerard\\u2019s connections were rooted on the East Coast, and she faced having to build a whole new network in the greater metropolitan Los Angeles area.\\n\\nNetwork-building, though, is a time-consuming activity. So, Gerard did what many people do to speed up the process: She sought help somewhere else. In her case, she turned to her family.\\n\\n\\u201cI went through a family friend to make a connection with an independent curator in LA, and that helped me get closer to finding a job,\\u201d recalled Gerard, who had been involved in curatorial work at Independence National Historic Park before traveling west. \\u201cThe museum world is a small field, and it\\u2019s so interconnected, but it still takes a lot of time. There\\u2019s never a guarantee the people in your circle will have the connections you need.\\u201d\\n\\nGerard has since built up an excellent network in Southern California, as well as an impressive professional resume. Recently she was appointed deputy director of the Laguna Art Museum\\u2014prior to that, she served as vice president of programs and collections at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana.\\n\\n> A tool like this is great in helping you get oriented and learn how to reach out in approachable ways to people in the field.

The platform aims to foster greater connections, learning opportunities, and a sense of community in an industry where access to careers and advancement isn\\u2019t always clear.\\n\\nSince its national launch in April 2020, membership has surged to more than 1,000 registered users.\\u00a0The platform addresses a crucial need for Gerard, who has made herself available as a mentor on POLARIS.\\n\\n\\u201cA tool like this is great in helping you get oriented and learn how to reach out in approachable ways to people in the field,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf POLARIS had existed when I was first looking, it would have changed my whole search.\\u201d\\n\\nCreating a Lifeline\\n-------------------\\n\\nSpearheaded by MLI@CGU Director Toni Guglielmo, POLARIS was developed and launched at a moment when no one had any idea what quarantine would like or how long it would last.\\n\\nThe timing, it turns out, couldn\\u2019t have been better.\\n\\n[![Image 1: MLI Director, Toni Guglielmo](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-MLI-Guglielmo-v3-400x400.jpg)](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-MLI-Guglielmo-v3.jpg)\\n\\nMLI@CGU Director Toni Guglielmo\\n\\n\\u201cStarting a new project during a global pandemic has been problematic for so many organizations, but it wasn\\u2019t for us,\\u201d explains Guglielmo, the associate editor of _Curator: The Museum Journal_ who received her doctorate at UC Santa Barbara. \\u201cIt soon became clear POLARIS was a timely response when in-person programs and communication channels were being suspended.

Every year, they receive millions of visitors and employ thousands of workers in gift shops and ticketing, installations, curating, archiving, and storage. Many jobs are hidden from the public\\u2019s naked eye but are vital in the museum business.\\n\\nDespite these considerable numbers and the common ground they share, many museums often operate like individual islands surrounded by the sea. It isn\\u2019t that they aren\\u2019t receptive to inquiries or questions from others in the field, but it can be very hard to gain access and find the right opportunity.\\n\\n\\u201cMuseum professionals can sometimes feel they have to \\u2018go it alone,\\u2019 which has been exacerbated by the isolation of the pandemic,\\u201d Guglielmo says. \\u201cWe designed POLARIS with the exact opposite in mind.

But then, in mid-2020, as quarantine continued, her husband received a job offer too sweet to refuse, and her family\\u2019s relocation to San Diego forced her to let go of this plum position and begin the hunt anew.\\n\\nWhat was different this time around? POLARIS.\\n\\n\\u201cSuddenly, I was staring down the barrel of a job search again, which was a stressful prospect,\\u201d she recalls. Still, she connected with a senior member of fundraising at the Metropolitan Art Museum through POLARIS. That connection gave her the advice and help she needed to make her career transition.\\n\\n\\u201cPOLARIS provides a framework and structure to make everything so much easier,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt gives you a starting point that says, \\u2018here\\u2019s a list of people willing to talk to you.\\u2019 You don\\u2019t have to send out countless query emails just to find the right connection. You can customize and start pulling from a list of willing people, which is fantastic.\\u201d\\n\\nAttracting Younger Users\\n------------------------\\n\\nLeAD Labs\\u2019 Jensen has noticed an encouraging trend among members joining POLARIS now: There\\u2019s a large influx of students and recent graduates.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is really exciting and different from what we\\u2019ve seen in the past with other programs that we\\u2019ve done with the institute,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve already been working with many established museum leaders for a while. Now it\\u2019s very exciting to see that, on POLARIS, we\\u2019re supporting a lot of folks who are just starting out on their potential career paths.\\u201d\\n\\nFor Jensen, having this influx of newcomers is important not just because it\\u2019s nice to have a wide variety of members at all experience levels. It\\u2019s important because it illuminates issues of diversity and representation.\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the strengths of the POLARIS model is that these resources are accessible to anyone no matter your socioeconomic status. You have virtual webinars and hands-on things to help you learn,\\u201d Jensen says.\\n\\nSome of POLARIS\\u2019s self-study material also reflects diversity and social injustice challenges that reached a fever pitch in 2020. That\\u2019s important, Jensen adds, and can be \\u201cincredibly impactful in helping new professionals develop the best skills before the bad habits have a chance to start.\\u201d\\n\\nGerard agrees.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just the platform\\u2019s efficiency that\\u2019s so great,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWe\\u2019re at a moment in history when inclusiveness is a priority for many organizations. That\\u2019s important because some larger museums haven\\u2019t been listening to the voices of everyone on their staff. I see POLARIS as a way of encouraging inclusivity. It\\u2019s a way of getting everyone to start talking to each other and breaking down those barriers and healing some perceptions of the field.\\u201d\\n\\nJoining POLARIS is currently free under the three-year federal grant. When the funding to support POLARIS ends in 2022, Guglielmo says she hopes to find other means to keep the platform running. She wants to continue providing a mentoring and networking space for POLARIS\\u2019s growing community. She also says it\\u2019s vital that POLARIS continues because it is the future of leadership training and support.\\n\\nPOLARIS, she says, offers \\u201ca new model for leadership development that\\u2019s inclusive, egalitarian, and accessible. Developing new museum leadership models of shared power that are collaborative and cross-departmental and that build organizational capacity has been in the works for many organizations.

Our students have a deep understanding of education as a social justice issue and see quality education for all as a civil right. They embody our mission to be deeply committed to academic excellence, equity, and integrity; to work diligently to develop the skills and attitudes necessary to teach every child as though teaching their own; to collaborate with the parents of their students, other educators and policy makers; and to use technology and other resources as a means to maximize achievement and opportunities.\\n\\n##### TEACHER EDUCATION\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFor more information about CGU\\u2019s Preliminary Credential + MA in Education program or its Induction program, please contact the Office of Admissions at [admissions@cgu.edu](mailto:admissions@cgu.edu) or call 909-607-7811.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nCGU\\u2019s Direct-to-Clear option allows you to earn a Preliminary Credential, a Master of Arts in Education, and a Clear Credential in just two years (with the option of one of those years teaching outside of Southern California).

The focus of the Preliminary Program is for the teacher candidate to develop mastery over the skill sets used by effective teachers (i.e., for them to become proficient teachers as measured by the Teacher Performance Expectations). Students can earn the following types of Preliminary Credentials in as little as four semesters:\\n\\n*   Multiple-Subject Credential (for those who want to teach all subjects in a self-contained classroom, like those typically found in elementary schools)\\n*   Single-Subject Credentials (for those who want to teach one subject in middle or high school)\\n    *   English\\n    *   Math\\n    *   Science\\n    *   Social Science\\n    *   World Languages: Spanish, French, Chinese\\n*   Education Specialist Credentials (for those who want to work with students with disabilities)\\n    *   Mild/Moderate Disabilities\\n    *   Moderate/Severe Disabilities\\n\\n**Step 2: Earn a California Clear Credential via an authorized Induction Program.** Within five years of earning a Preliminary Credential, the teacher must earn the Clear Credential through an authorized Induction Program. Some teachers earn their Clear Credential through a district-run Induction Program. CGU\\u2019s Induction Program is a great alternative. The focus of an Induction Program is to help teachers take responsibility and ownership of their professional growth.

A plausible legal or ethical basis for the return of the object to the source nation.\\n\\nThe objects involved in these cases can be classified within one of the following three categories:\\n\\n1.  Documented located objects \\u2013 Claims from source nations for the return of a specific object, or objects, known to be in foreign custody. These claims are not limited to those based on allegations of illegal acquisition through looting or theft. They include, therefore, arguably rhetorical claims like those for the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece and the Rosetta Stone and Bust of\\u00a0Nefertiti\\u00a0to Egypt.\\n2.  Documented\\u00a0non-located objects \\u00a0\\u2013 Claims from source nations for the return of objects believed to have been taken out of the country, but whose current location is unknown. These claims include those relating to objects that may have been:1) Plundered from museums or historic sites leading up to, during, or following armed conflict or civil unrest; or\\u00a02) Discovered to have been illicitly removed from a source nation during peacetime.\\u00a0Claims include those made for specific, well-documented objects (e.g., Iraq National Museum, Baghdad in 2003 and the Egyptian Museum, Cairo in 2011), as well as broad claims (e.g., \\u201cAnything Syrian\\u201d).\\n3.  Objects returned without overt solicitation by the source nation \\u2013 These cases involve\\u00a0_sua sponte_\\u00a0return to source nations of objects held by foreigners.

While the emphasis of the institute\\u2019s work remains heavily on aspects of international money and financial economics, its research portfolio covers many aspects of economic policy. CIEPS\\u2019s activities are administered by the director, Thomas Willett; the deputy director, Graham Bird; and a distinguished advisory council.\\n\\nWhile largely applied in nature, research at CIEPS is based on the belief that such analysis must rest on firm theoretical foundations. However, no one theory or methodological approach is best for all situations. As a consequence of this philosophy, the work of the institute draws both on conventional assumptions regarding rational agents and on more recent developments in behavioral economics. It recognizes important aspects of political economy as well as institutional design in formulating policy. In addition to using modern econometric techniques to analyze large data sets that have often been assembled by CIEPS itself, the research of the institute also sees a place for carefully crafted case studies that add depth, nuances, and richness to large sample analysis. Quantitative and qualitative research methodologies are viewed as being complementary. A particular focus of CIEPS has been the integration of economic and political analysis, and the institute has played a leading role in developing the field of international political economy. Through its research, CIEPS has had a discernible impact on economic policy at both national and international levels.\\n\\nResearch conducted by CIEPS members is regularly published in leading academic journals, and the institute has gained an international reputation both for its high-quality research and for its role as a leader in promoting work that crosses conventional disciplinary boundaries, with a special focus being on political economy, behavioral considerations, and the role of institutions. Conventional academic metrics, such as citations, reflect the high rate of research productivity achieved by members of the institute, and the strong impact that this research has had both on academic developments in the field of international money and finance and on the design of economic policy worldwide. CIEPS members are frequently invited to give presentations based on their research to meetings of policy makers at national, regional, and global levels.\\n\\nCIEPS strongly encourages and facilitates collaborative research between its faculty members, its wide network of research associates, and the large number of doctoral students working in the field of international money and finance. At any one time, there are normally about 35 students undertaking doctoral study in an area of research covered by CIEPS. The institute is particularly proud of the way in which it helps train the next generation of researchers, many of whom have gone on to secure positions throughout the world in academia, government economic service, and international organizations, as well as the private sector.\\n\\nCIEPS sponsors a bi-weekly research workshop that analyzes current topics in international monetary and financial economics, as well as domestic economic policy in advanced, emerging, and developing economies. It also organizes seminars and an annual student-faculty conference. It regularly arranges sessions at international conferences run by professional associations. By participating in such events, CIEPS members are able to present their research and disseminate their findings to a global audience of fellow researchers and practitioners.\\n\\nCurrent research topics under investigation at CIEPS include:\\n\\n*   Exchange rate regimes and currency areas\\n*   Economic and political determinants of financial and economic crises\\n*   International capital flows, surges, reversals, and sudden stops: causes and consequences\\n*   International financial markets, credit booms, and banking crises\\n*   The political economy of the International Monetary Fund\\n*   The financing of economic development; foreign aid, remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI)\\n*   Macroeconomic policy, international interdependence, and the trilemma\\n*   Contagion from financial crises; where, when, and why\\n*   The performance of financial markets; market efficiency versus behavioral finance\\n*   Issues in international and comparative political economy\\n*   China, emerging economies, and the global economy\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Claremont Institute for Economic Policy Studies \\u00b7\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/center/claremont-institute-for-economic-policy-studies/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Advanced evaluation practice for societal impact.\\n\\nThe Doctor of Evaluation Practice (D.Eval) program is designed to meet the critical demand for skilled evaluators who can address pressing societal issues in industries like education, public health, healthcare, human services, philanthropic foundations, community-based non-profits, technology, organizational development, international development, and government.

I don\\u2019t know where to direct you to find hand sanitizer, but I can tell you about how, on my mission, I have learned to find hope.\\n\\nThese past few weeks have been absolutely crazy for all of us, but I have personally had a hard time grasping it.\\n\\nAbout 10 1/2 months ago, I was on a plane to Brazil where I planned to stay for a year and half in the city of Santos, inviting people to come unto Christ. I arrived, began learning the language, and soon found myself having opportunities to serve and to teach. I loved the people. I loved the country. I loved the experiences I was having and wrote emails home describing my love for it all.\\n\\nAs missionaries, we don\\u2019t know a lot about news and world events, But suddenly, about 2 months ago, I began hearing about a new virus that was killing a lot of people in China. I assumed it was far away and even asked my family \\u201cIs this Covid thing real?\\u201d They told me it was, indeed, \\u201creal,\\u201d and we talked about how to be careful, how I could wash my hands more often, and how I should listen to the counsel of my mission president. Pretty much, I assumed this was a far away thing \\u2013 something that wouldn\\u2019t affect my life. Well, one month later, I found myself calling home to let my family know that I was going into quarantine. Church in Brazil was cancelled, and we missionaries were to purchase a two week supply of food and sanitation needs.\\n\\nThe world turned even further upside down, when, less than 24 hours later, I found myself not in quarantine, but on a plane headed from Sao Paulo back to my home in the USA. My family didn\\u2019t even know I was en route.\\n\\n![Image 1: Eliza](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/06/R_3qUJc5IMuNrgnko_IMG_4388-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nSo much was changing so suddenly. There were feelings of uncertainty, tears, and confusion, I couldn\\u2019t say goodbye to the people I had come to love. I barely even had time to pack my things and get to the mission office. With so much turmoil, I realized I wasn\\u2019t leaving much space for hope, for the Savior\\u2019s love, or for peace. I had spent the last 10 months having people pour out their souls and problems to me and helping them to see hope and light through the gospel. But now, I was the one needing it.\\n\\nLet me share one scripture that brought me hope during those crazy days. It is found in Ether 12:4 which states \\u201cWherefore, whoso believeth in God might, with surety, hope for a better world, yea even a place at the right hand of God.\\u201d\\n\\nI am so grateful for the hope the gospel provides.

Together with [Stefan Boettcher](http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/boettcher), he developed the method of [Extremal Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_optimization) that has since been applied to problems ranging from social networks to protein folding. Other research interests include the phase structure of combinatorial problems over ensembles of random instances, using this phase structure to motivate better algorithms and extending the picture to random network models closely reflecting real-world data. Dr. Percus has led several interdisciplinary project teams at Los Alamos, and has organized numerous conferences and workshops exploring the overlap between combinatorics, phase transitions and computational complexity.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Allon Percus\", \"source\": \"http://scholar.cgu.edu/allon-percus/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[The Flame](https://flame.cgu.edu/) ![Image 1: Site Icon](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cropped-CGU-Favicon-Cropped-150x150.png)\\n\\nClaremont Graduate University Magazine\\n\\n*   [Current Issue](https://flame.cgu.edu/)\\n*   [Past Issues](https://www.cgu.edu/news/the-flame/)\\n*   [Topics](https://flame.cgu.edu/topics/)\\n*   [Bookshelf](https://flame.cgu.edu/bookshelf/)\\n*   [Class Notes](https://flame.cgu.edu/class-notes/)\\n*   [Search \\ud83d\\udd0d](https://flame.cgu.edu/search/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTopic: Economics\\n----------------\\n\\n[Why Does Alcohol Turn People Into Jerks?](https://flame.cgu.edu/why-does-alcohol-turn-people-into-jerks/)\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDrinking might make some people more friendly and generous, but Paul Zak\\u2019s new research shows that\\u2019s not always the case when a group activity is involved.\\n\\n**2022 Spring**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Economics \\u2014 Topics \\u2014 The Flame\", \"source\": \"https://flame.cgu.edu/topics/economics\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Joseph Smith and the Prophetic Tradition:**\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n**A Comparative Inquiry**\\n-------------------------\\n\\n**October 20-21, 2005**\\n\\n**Featured Speakers:**\\n\\n*   Richard Bushman, Columbia University\\n*   Jan Shipps, Indiana University-Purdue University\\n\\n**Presenters:**\\n\\n*   Robert Millet, Brigham Young University\\n*   Carl Ernst, University of North Carolina\\n*   Rennie Schoepflin, La Sierra University\\n*   Grant Wacker, Duke University Divinity School\\n*   David Carpenter, St. Joseph\\u2019s University\\n\\n**Sponsored by:**\\n\\nClaremont Graduate University, School of Religion\\n\\nThursday, 7:30 pm \\u2013 Mudd Theatre, Claremont School of Theology\\n\\nFriday, 9am \\u2013 5:30pm \\u2013 Scripps Humanities Building\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Fall Conference 2005: Joseph Smith and the Prophetic Tradition - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/fall-conference-2005-joseph-smith-and-the-prophetic-tradition/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Darrell Moore is a visiting associate professor of cultural studies at Claremont Graduate University.

Students are matched either by their program coordinator or the director of financial aid, depending on whether the fellowship is designated to a specific program.\\n\\nStudents are matched to fellowships throughout the year. However, most students are informed of this honor at the beginning of the academic year (August/September). The person naming the fellowship attempts to match students who have qualified for a certain amount of aid to funds with that amount of aid available. For funds with preferences, multiple factors are considered, including whether the fellowship was assigned last year to a student who is eligible again this year and how the student is performing (or, in the case of an incoming student, how the student is expected to perform).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAt the time most students are notified about their financial aid packages they learn the amount of their fellowship award, but the specific fund with which they will be matched may not yet have been determined. This is because it is a relatively fast process to calculate the amount each student needs and allocate that amount from the total pool of funding available. It takes longer to match each student with a specific fellowship fund. During the academic year, as students are matched with fellowships, we inform them about the fellowship they received.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStewardship reporting letters are sent out on a rolling basis, with most endowed fellowship reports being sent in the fall semester. This allows time for the students to be matched with funds. Many prepare thank-you messages which are then forwarded to donors. If a student does not write a note, CGU sends the donor a report identifying a student recipient and, in the case of an endowed fellowship, information on the endowment\\u2019s performance.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWhenever possible, we try to continue a student\\u2019s association with the same fellowship from year to year. Students must continue to meet the criteria of the fellowship and be in good standing with the university in order to remain eligible. Because of the specifications of some fellowships, however, they may go to a new student each year.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIf no student meets the criteria for a specific fellowship, we may wait to award the fund, in case a student who fits the preference becomes eligible. By the end of the year, if no student has met the criteria, we will inform the donor of why this was the case.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn the case of an endowed fellowship, it is often awarded in the academic year following the year the pledge was completed so that the endowment has time to grow. However, please note that the first fellowship award depends on the timing of the gift.\\n\\nAn annual fellowship is generally awarded during the same academic year it was given but may also depend on the timing of the gift.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nDonors cannot select the recipients of their fellowships. Instead, qualified CGU staff choose the recipients based on the criteria set forth by the donor.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nEach year, CGU holds an annual fellowship luncheon in the spring. During this event, we make every effort to seat fellowship donors and their recipients at the same table. If this is not possible, you will be provided with an opportunity during the event to meet other student(s) who benefited from a named fellowship. Other opportunities to meet with the recipient(s) can usually be arranged upon request.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThere are two types of fellowships: endowed and annual. An endowed fellowship lives on in perpetuity as part of CGU\\u2019s endowment, and the growth and earnings on that fund are awarded to a student(s) based on the payout formula determined by the CGU Board of Trustees (currently 5 percent). An annual fellowship is one that can be given on a yearly basis to support a student or students. Both types are governed by criteria established by the donor. For example, we have fellowships that support female management students or African American students studying English.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThere are minimum amounts required to establish either an endowed fellowship or an annual fellowship.

However, previous longitudinal research on tobacco marketing effects has not focused on particularly vulnerable populations or on youth during transitions in later adolescence when tobacco use experimentation often escalates and consolidates into life-long habits. Previous longitudinal research also has not investigated likely explanatory processes (intervening cognitive processes/mediators) through which marketing exposure has effects on tobacco use trajectories. The present project focuses on a vulnerable, lower SES, multi-ethnic (primarily Hispanic and non-Hispanic White) population of youth with substantially higher rates of smoking than the national norm, during ages in which dramatic changes in tobacco habits occur (16 to 20). Something must explain the substantially higher rates of tobacco use escalation in this population, and tobacco marketing at retail outlets in lower SES neighborhoods is one strong possibility.\\n\\nThis project also evaluates key credible explanatory processes, well-grounded in basic research across several disciplines. Some of the most credible processes that can explain marketing effects, not previously studied in this domain, have received consistent support from multiple lines of independent evidence across neural, cognitive, and behavioral levels of analysis \\u2014 not merely survey or psychometric evidence. The study of marketing effects in a vulnerable population over critical ages, coupled with research on some of the most credible explanatory processes, will provide clear regulatory guidance to the FDA about any needs for new regulations on point-of-sale tobacco marketing (POS). Regulatory changes would be strongly suggested by firm evidence that POS has especially strong, explainable effects in lower SES neighborhoods and vulnerable populations. To investigate these effects and credible processes this project implements a cohort-sequential design in 1000 vulnerable youth from a multi-ethnic population in southern California. Three design features in this proposal are especially important to provide strong inference for any link between POS tobacco advertising and tobacco use, which is needed to support FDA policy decisions. First, the design allows the most rigorous testing of the temporal relationship among the variables, to date, one of the key criteria for causality. Second, testing for the intervening variables will provide support for plausible causal mechanisms also buttressed by extensive basic research. Finally, potential confounders and covariates are comprehensively assessed and thoroughly evaluated.\\n\\nThe project provides the most rigorous, potentially most informative study to date about tobacco marketing effects in older youth. Results are likely to reveal why some older adolescents have substantially higher smoking rates (more than double the national average), leading to critical health risks in the future. Thus, the project has a strong potential for major regulatory implications for protecting the public health in adolescents.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Marketing and Explanatory Processes in Tobacco Progression Among Vulnerable Youth \\u2014 School of Community & Global Health\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/marketing-and-explanatory-processes-in-tobacco-progression-among-vulnerable-youth/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### This program is not currently accepting applications.\\n\\nWe recommend the [MA in Politics](https://www.cgu.edu/academics/program/ma-politics/) with a concentration in International Political Economy.\\n\\n### The Master of Arts in International Political Economy (MAIPE) trains students to analyze increasingly complex global interactions and to address large-scale political and economic uncertainties.\\n\\nAssessing globalization\\u2019s effects within the interconnected realms of politics, economics, and policy requires a new set of specialized educational tools.

We also discuss her own projects on film as a colonial and counter-colonial object in Malaysia and Singapore, and the various ways of documenting environmental degradation in contemporary Southeast Asia.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nHello. Welcome to Breaking the Shackles of Time, a podcast about writing and other topics. We are continuing our new trend here with episode five. I have a wonderful guest with me today. I have Dr. Nadine Chan with me today. Welcome. Thank you so much for being here.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nThank you for having me.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. I appreciate you coming and visiting and having a conversation. For a little bit of background about Dr. Chan, she\\u2019s a assistant professor of cultural studies at Claremont Graduate University. Her areas of research and teaching include media historiography and theory, post-colonial and new empire studies, environmental humanities media, and the Anthropocene, visual studies, global Asia, South East Asian film and media, amongst others. She received her PhD in cinema and media studies from USC, University of Southern California, and is a former Harper Schmidt fellow through the Society of Fellows at the University of Chicago, and a Global Asia postdoctoral fellow from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nFrom what I know, she has two main projects right now. One is a project that\\u2019s conceptualizing film as an object that is animated by both colonial and counter colonial energies. And hopefully we\\u2019ll have a chance to talk a bit more about that, as well as another project that\\u2019s focusing more on the visualizations of the Anthropocene, particularly through questions of archive information and effect. And I think both of those studies will be great examples of the uniqueness of cultural studies as a field.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nJust a bit more. Her research has been supported by a Social Science Research Council, Andrew W. Mellon International Dissertation Research Fellowship, Global Asia Postdoctoral Fellowship amongst others. And we are welcoming her here today to discuss the unique qualities of the field of cultural studies, as well as her specific work within that. So once again, thank you so much for joining me. And I would like to start as I typically do at a more general level, and then we\\u2019ll narrow in to your specific research. My sense is the audience might not fully understand what cultural studies is uniquely as a field or an academic discipline, so if you had to describe it to someone who doesn\\u2019t know anything about it, how would you do that?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nYeah. So first of all, thank you for having me Marcus and for that intro. Well, cultural studies, it\\u2019s a lot of things. I mean, you could ask anyone in the field what the discipline is and they might all well give you different answers. But I think one thing we would all agree on is that as a discipline, it\\u2019s fundamentally interested in unearthing infrastructures of inequality, oppression, thinking about networks of power and politics an the production and circulation and use of cultural objects or at particular cultural moments. So, yeah, I mean the concerns of cultural studies, as I say, will always be fundamentally about the interrogation of power and the structures of power in whatever forms. So I think in the nutshell, that is what it would really be. Yeah, I guess I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s a discipline that\\u2019s built around an ethos, the ethos of always doing scholarship that in some way intervenes into questions of power, hegemony and ideology.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Critical Understandings of Culture - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/critical-understandings-of-culture-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Marcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. So that\\u2019s really interesting. I mean, it seems to me that then it has kind of that social justice critical paradigm, and then it\\u2019s also very pragmatic, it seems like are very practical. Like the way you\\u2019re talking about the use of methods, you are able to pull from established methods and sounds like the humanities and the social sciences just very directly, as well as other fields to just, okay, we\\u2019ve got a problem here that we want to solve, or we have something that we want to study and highlight, and we can just use whatever method best accomplishes that. So that leads a bit into what my next question was going to be, which was what\\u2019s different about cultural studies compared to anthropology and sociology? And it sounds to me that those are two key elements, that anthropology and sociology don\\u2019t have explicit critical or social justice lenses, right?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nRight. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I think coming back to it, that\\u2019s really sort of cultural studies in a nutshell. That sort of ethos of political intervention kind of undermining and breaking apart sort of structures of power and seeing sort of the dirt and the networks, and then the tissues of connectivity that make those structures of power happen. And absolutely in the sense that I think cultural studies allows us to have the freedom to teach ourselves or to get the skills that we need in order to answer the questions that are important.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo I mean, obviously I\\u2019m not trained in these other fields that you mentioned, so I can\\u2019t really speak for that. But what reads to me as quite, I guess, liberating about cultural studies is that we pull methods from disciplines in order to speak to the research question or the research problem that we have. So it\\u2019s very much a process whereby our question and our research problems drive the methodology, drive the process and not the other way around. So for instance, if say literary analysis of a novel makes sense for one chapter, we do that. If ethnography makes sense, say in terms of how this novel was being received in its society or how it continues to circulate in the everyday and it\\u2019s become a part of our everyday life, and if that works for another chapter, that\\u2019s great too. So in cultural studies, we find our methods. We find methods that fit our questions as opposed to sort of the other way around.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nIt sounds to me then that, I mean, there\\u2019s kind of a tied along with that then I\\u2019m sure is kind of the idea that situatedness is really important or the cultural and power dynamics of a specific situation. That\\u2019s probably historical, as well as geographically bound, probably in some cases. Power represents itself in dynamic ways and expressed in different social institutions and conglomerations, I guess. So when you narrow it down, I\\u2019m assuming and ask these critical questions geared towards social justice about specific, I think you said cultural events earlier, so about a cultural event, my assumption is that tied into this approach is the idea that there\\u2019s something unique here happening that isn\\u2019t necessarily transferable to other cultural events in other places. Like maybe some of it is, but you have to approach the situatedness of that specific circumstance for the uniqueness that it is. And so knowledge has that character too, or what we can know about the world or about these power dynamics is that they are situated in unique circumstances. Would that be correct?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo historically it has its roots in Marxist critique with two lineages in the Birmingham School, in the Frankfurt School coming out of the 60s and 70s, and the Birmingham School in particular. And this is how I teach these, my cultural studies courses is very much interested in the convergence with media studies and studies of mass culture. Questions of popular and mass culture, such as cinema, television, new media, and even print forms like advertising the press and so forth. So you have all these so-called intellectual trajectories coming out of its beginnings in Marxist roots and add this a tremendous array of very new and exciting methodologies and perspectives, including that of feminism, sexuality studies, critical race studies, post-colonial studies, new empire studies, as well as various sort theoretical and modes, deconstruction and what have you. Which have over the past few decades really pushed and challenged cultural studies to continuously grow and to reinvent itself.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Critical Understandings of Culture - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/critical-understandings-of-culture-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Nadine Chan:  \\nAnd that\\u2019s one of, I guess, the exciting things about this particular field and working in this particular field in that there is always this conversation happening between different and emergent sort of schools of thought. Cultural studies has never been a static field. In that way, it kind of defies a particular aesthetic definition of it. But that said at its heart, as I mentioned are its Marxist roots. And this is an intellectual tradition that I still emphasize in my teaching today and is particularly pertinent in light of our neoliberal moment and sort of the effects of that. To my mind, there will always be a kind of leftist, progressive element to the ethos of cultural studies. A desire to interrogate the structures of power, whether they be in the forms of capital or institutions such as incarceration or ideological methods, ideological modes of mass culture, like cinema and at present digital new media, for instance.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSome would say that cultural studies has lost its way in recent decades. It\\u2019s become so diffused. It\\u2019s become sort of the pot of critical thinking and critical theory and critical work everywhere. But that\\u2019s a good thing. It shows how prevalent our modes of inquiry are in these other disciplines. So as I mentioned, if one were to sort of trace the lineage of the field, it was developed by British Marxist academics in the mid 20th Century and it\\u2019s since been taken up by many disciplines worldwide. Interestingly, it\\u2019s sort of institutionalization, particularly in the U.S. into programs and departments, would have been something perhaps that the founding, the initial thinkers behind cultural studies might have been uncomfortable with because of the very nature of cultural studies so called counter institutionalizing, and even one would say radically anti-disciplinary bent.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo there have been many sort of scholarly efforts to pin down cultural studies. Its formation, its disciplinary parameters where it\\u2019s heading in recent years. But at the same time, this is not one of the questions that we in cultural studies should be holding near and dear to our heart. Because at the heart of it, what we are interested in this field is very much a kind of critical engagement in questions of power, hegemony, ideology, and in all of these things. It\\u2019s becoming, I think now more than ever, cultural studies is experiencing a kind of revival looking at say our present day media driven ideology, driven politics, how this converges with the emergence of new mass medias, social and digital media, and how structures of race and social inequality and capital undergirds all of that. So we are really kind of seeing a moment that was very much like the earlier period out of which cultural studies emerged. And we are seeing a revival of that moment now. So I think it\\u2019s a very exciting time to be part of this field.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nIt sounds to me that what you\\u2019re describing as situatedness is a really important element of how cultural studies approaches culture. You\\u2019ve talked about different cultural events or different moments as being the main topics or the main focus of study, and then looking at different expressions or elements of culture. But it seems to me, and if I understand correctly, the epistemological approach behind this is that there are things that go on in situated context that are going to be unique to those contexts in ways that might not be easily transferable to other ones. So there isn\\u2019t some overarching knowledge about culture that we\\u2019re going to be able to investigate and learn from specific instances of culture. It\\u2019s going to be much more contextualized, and maybe there are things that are transferable, but for the most part, you have to do the work of really digging into a specific situation.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nGood question. Yeah. So in that sense, I think cultural of studies does both and it can do both. It is definitely not a feel which makes claims toward grand universal theory. I mean, to think it\\u2019s not say physics or philosophy, which makes these large overarching claims. But-\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nCertain philosophers, not all.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nRight, yes. Certain philosophies. So in that way it is not interest\\u2026 Well, it\\u2019s hard to say, but it is less interested in having these grand claims than it is about looking at how power and politics works. And it\\u2019s hard to do that without some form of specificity. But at the same time, it could be, but nor does it necessarily have to be a field that\\u2019s mired in minutia in these tiny little esoteric moments.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Critical Understandings of Culture - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/critical-understandings-of-culture-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Nadine Chan:  \\nComing back to that idea that we were talking about earlier, which is about how cultural studies as a field is very much invested in asking sort of questions that matter, questions about power that matter. So in our work, yes, we definitely want to make our researchers situated as historically grounded and grounded in the everyday of the social structures around that particular moment as possible. But we also kind of want to go a step further and to think, what does this mean in terms of how power works? What does this mean in terms of how hegemony works? So how does ideology work and how do I see these sort of formations and structures happening through my whatever case study? If that makes sense. So it makes claims awards, both sort of ends of the spectrum. It speaks to larger concerns, but it\\u2019s also sort very much grounded in the concrete and the specific.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. And I think that makes a lot of sense to me too. Especially, I mean, I\\u2019m sure once you bring in the RFU approach or think of the field or work through the field with more of an emphasis on the Marxist tradition as well, I\\u2019m sure more of that goes into it. Because given the predominance of capitalism and the capitalist structure, those sorts of economic and then political and all the other sorts of interconnected power dynamics that are going to move out and through the way capital functions, I\\u2019m sure there are going to be things that cross boundaries as well, that you could talk about that\\u2019s learned through specific situations.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nYeah, that\\u2019s what is exciting about cultural studies is that you can have these conversations across disciplines, across fields, across area studies even because they\\u2019re all kind of coming back to this notion of how power works and how do we grapple with the meat of it and the meshiness underneath these various structures. So yes, it speaks big, but it\\u2019s also very, very kind of done well. It\\u2019s also kind of very rooted in the specifics of the moment and place.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nSo I would love to jump in a bit more to your specific research. And I would love if you could use some of this as an opportunity to also talk about why some of these areas of study are so important in our contemporary understanding of power dynamics right now. Because I\\u2019m sure as you\\u2019re talking about, there\\u2019s a resurgence of the original spirit of where cultural studies came from in the 60s and some of these ideas, my sense, I don\\u2019t know, you should please correct me if I\\u2019m wrong, but some of these areas of study were probably present then, and then some of them have developed over the years. Then I would love to hear a bit more about why some of these are important in the field and they\\u2019re being looked at instead of others.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nSo to start with the first project that you\\u2019re working on that I mentioned earlier. So the first is that you want to look at film as both colonial and counter colonial and do this specifically through a study of colonial educational films in British Malaya in Singapore, from the 1910s to the present. And by doing this also offer theoretical and historiographical framework for colonial cinemas and their post-colonial afterlife.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nSo this is really interesting to me where you\\u2019re using film studies here in a certain theoretical and historiographical framework to approach the workings of colonialism specifically in the context of British Malaya and Singapore. What drew you to this and how do you approach this in a way that you think is, if you could use what we talked about in theory a bit earlier, how does the way you approach this specifically reflect the values of cultural studies? I\\u2019m sorry to give you a three part question, but then just some of the details. What are some of the really important things or interesting things to you that you feel like you\\u2019re learning through this study?\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Critical Understandings of Culture - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/critical-understandings-of-culture-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Nadine Chan:  \\nYeah, sure. Thanks for that question. And I\\u2019m kind of working through it now that you\\u2019ve asked. And I guess there are many ways for me to get at that question. But I suppose if I were to draw a through line through all of my research interests, they\\u2019re all about questions of media, medium specificity, and power. I\\u2019m always interested in how power works through our mediated forms of knowledge. And I want to tease out how webs of power structures happen. And I take these to mean different things at different points in the work. So it could be colonialism, it could be sort of environmental degradation. It could be kind of exploitative capitalism. How these things are continued and how they can be unraveled, but doing so through the specific cultural object of media.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo there\\u2019s this book that I really like, Ann Stoler\\u2019s, Duress: Imperial Durabilities of Our Times that I teach in my course on media and durable empires, that really speak to this idea of the durabilities of Imperial formations. I\\u2019m interested in thinking about how empire in his colonial forms looked different in the 20th Century, in the 21st Century, but how one can pass out these various threads of capital, of race through these so-called different political moments over time. So how are these of sort of formations durable through time, I guess?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nAnd then I became interested in cinema as a mass medium that came about in the late\\u2026 Let\\u2019s see now, getting scrambled on my dates\\u2026 the late 1800s, and then coincided with colonialism in its late stage and the tide of capitalist modernity that happened in many parts of the world. So there was this great kind of confluence between new forms of empire in the 1900s and late 1800s and the emergence of this mode of mass culture being that of cinema. And this is what led me to my first project, A Cinema Under the Palms: Colonial World Making in an Unruly Medium.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo here, I mean this book begins with the premise that in colonial situations, cinema was never just about entertainment, but was very much entangled with increasing forms of colonial governance in everyday life. And I look at the context of British Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia and Singapore, as sites where, one of the first sites in the world, where colonial governments were experimenting with using films to produce of semi-literate citizens and spectators, who kind of shared this, a notion, had a shared notion of what it means to be a subject that was part of the empire.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo in many ways that where never before possible, colonial cinema could recreate an artificial world where time and space and human and natural environments could be rearranged on the surface of celluloid according to very colonial logic. Through film, you could have the British Empire pictured together. The world could be reassembled as a visualization of Imperial capital and extension of Imperial cartographies and arranged according to vernacular time. So a lot of this book is very much about thinking about how the very logics of empire can be found through the ontology of cinema.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo it\\u2019s not so much a book that\\u2019s interested in tracing representation. I\\u2019m not terribly interested in like, \\u201cOh, look at how native people in Southeast Asia were being represented on film.\\u201d That\\u2019s not really the interest here. But it\\u2019s really thinking about how the very technology, the aesthetics, form, the ontology of cinema itself speaks to colonial logics that emerge at the time of its being.-\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nWow, so-\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\n\\u2026 and so that\\u2019s part of the book\\u2019s first part of the argument. The book\\u2019s second part of the argument, and that comes back to your question on the counter colonial part, is that in spite of the mediums kind of emergence as a tool of empire, it was also very much a space for counter colonial resistance and possibility. And this is where I get at what\\u2019s at the title of the book, Colonial World Making in an Unruly Medium. There is something very fundamentally unruly about cinema. While it helped to build this empire, it was also a source of its disruption. And this is where maybe the cultural studies part of the equation comes in, in that I look for these so-called counter colonial energies in various places around the cinematic object.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Critical Understandings of Culture - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/critical-understandings-of-culture-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Nadine Chan:  \\nSo it\\u2019s not just looking at the object itself, but looking at how it was circulated or failed to circulate. Looking at how the tech technology worked or failed to work coherently. It failed to sort of capture the tropics in a particular way. It failed to capture dark skin exposed correctly. So there were all these failures within the medium itself, not to mention in terms of how it was received. So some of the work that I do involved finding out these histories about how the film was received and continues to be received among people in Malaysia. And this gives it a kind of social life and an afterlife that exists beyond the nature of the project. I mean the object of colonial cinema itself. So on the one hand, I have this argument about the cinema as a colonial world maker. But on the other hand, I also have this argument about cinema as an unruly medium. And so that\\u2019s kind of the trajectory for the first book.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. So that\\u2019s so interesting. So on the one hand, you\\u2019re looking at it in terms of a colonial instrument of sorts, like the intended original, okay, we\\u2019ve got this medium, that\\u2019s going to be more powerful than\\u2026 I mean, I can imagine people think this is going to be more powerful than print in many respects and in books and in other ways. Let\\u2019s craft a new world through this medium type thing as an instrument of colonialization. But then on the other hand, and I have to say I mean, it sounds really interesting, all the different ways that you described looking at how it didn\\u2019t work. I mean all the way from being distributed or received to all the other different ways that it just, that didn\\u2019t pan out or people used it in other subversive ways. I don\\u2019t mean to ask this question, but I\\u2019m interested in it, so is it close? How are you doing with the project? Is it going to be ready soon?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nIs close. Yes.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nCool. Because I would like to take a look at it.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nFingers crossed it will be done very, very soon. So yeah, I\\u2019ve been working on it for a while now and I think it\\u2019s time for it to be out in the world. I\\u2019ve already started researching and I\\u2019m presenting stuff for my second project. So I\\u2019m eager to start thinking about that and bridging some of the arguments in my first project to my second one. So I\\u2019m in the process of tying up the loose ends. To a certain degree, revisions can never be complete because coming back to this whole notion of cultural studies, speaking to critical questions of our moment, you can write a historical project. Mine is a historical project. It ends in the late 50s, but it always speaks to the questions that drive us today. I mean, it always gets back to this question of media, media and power, sort of media and it\\u2019s counter possibility. Which are questions that we\\u2019re kind of thinking about today too.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI think we should jump to your next project.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nOkay, cool. Yeah.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. So because you were saying there\\u2019s some development too, or at least some integration or some tie between the two. So is this the one on the visualizations of the Anthropocene?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nThat\\u2019s right. Yeah.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nCool.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s a project that I\\u2019ve been very excited, in many ways came to me quite naturally and quite, I would say almost in the quite fluidly from the first project. So the first project thinks about pretty much coloniality in the 1900s. And this project thinks about the environmental crises as an extension of capital. So very much in alignment with Jason Moore\\u2019s stuff on the capitalist scene where coloniality was its dominant proponent at an earlier moment. So I see this almost really natural convergence of my second project, which is on visual media, data visualization, and the environmental. Thinking back about that earlier point I made about what do imperial formations look like across through different sort of political moments and formations? How can we look to the environmental issues that we are facing as also an extension of \\u201cimperial formations\\u201d or empire?\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Critical Understandings of Culture - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/critical-understandings-of-culture-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Nadine Chan:  \\nSo my second project is candidly titled Documenting Friction in the Extractive Zone: Visualizing Ecological Milieus of Uncertainty and Loss. And it thinks about various visual instruments that I use to document the world and to record so-called natural phenomena, particularly in the context of Southeast Asia. And so I look at indexical media forms such as cinema and photography, but also new digital and computational forms of information visualization, such as data mapping, scientific modeling of things such as climate change, air pollution, meteorology. In other words, it\\u2019s kind of interested in how the ways in which data of complex systems, predictive models kind of make visible, immediate, and apparent for human understanding things such as the long duration of environmental duress. What Rob Nixon would call the long dyings and slow violences of planetary degradation. And so my project is interested in looking at what are the visual tools in which we use to visualize that and what is limiting and problematic about these tools.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nSo I\\u2019m kind of working through several research questions now. First of all, how do our visual media and methods of information visualization produce our sense of planet and planetary time? How do these modes of seeing ecological crisis within zones of invisibility and representational failure work? What are its limitations and mid conditions of uncertainty, degradation and loss? What does it mean to have an indexical medium that can only document the aftermath? And in spite of this, can modes of counter knowledge or occluded visibility still become productive ways of witnessing and building relationality with our planet. I\\u2019m starting to go into this area of complexity science and the idea of complexity and complex systems is another through line for the book. And here I\\u2019m really kind of referencing complexity studies in math and computational science and we talk about interdisciplinary.\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nBut I mean, complexity science kind of explains non-linear systems in which large networks work in very unpredictable ways. So weather systems, climate epidemiology, the worldwide web, financial markets are some instances of non-linear systems. And I think where I want to take this book to word is kind of thinking about an ontology of visuality and an ontology of knowledge, which is less about indexical transparent immediate relationality to the real, which is very much what things like photography or cinema or even data modeling is all about. But finding ways in which one can picture complexity in the humanities and in media studies, perhaps as a way of taking us closer, hermeneutically toward inhabiting milieus of uncertainty and loss. So in other words, I want to move away from the hardening of knowledge, but quite the opposite, the opening up of media to productive possibilities of counter knowledge.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. And that uncertainty is probably a bit chaotic too, would you say?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nYeah. Yeah.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nSo how do you represent chaos in \\\\[inaudible 00:33:24\\\\].\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nExactly. Exactly. How do you represent chaos? And my first book let\\u2019s not forget is about cinema as an unruly medium. So there\\u2019s this kind of through line of the chaotic and the unruliness and the counter this and that throughout both works.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah. Is there any final takeaway or anything you would like to leave the audience with about cultural studies before we wrap?\\n\\nNadine Chan:  \\nYeah, for sure. So if we could draw a thread through our various meandering conversation today, one of the things that really sticks out is about how the field is very much invested in questions of, I guess you could say social justice. And social justice can mean a lot of different things, particularly in cultural studies. It could mean kind of literal going out on the streets and activism. It could mean community work. It could mean socially engaged scholarship and the latter. I think socially engaged scholarship is very much what we are interested in doing here at CGU, whether or not the work is historical or whether or not the work is situated in another place, in another time where we\\u2019re all interested at sort of getting at these questions that matter, questions of power and through socially engaged work that always comes back to the ethos of cultural studies. Which is how does power work and what are the ways in which we can unseat that or unthink that, or find different modes of epistemological possibility to rethink the ways in which sort of forms hegemony replicate themselves?\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nProfessor Chan, thank you so much for joining us today.

It was tough trying to maintain my spiritual life. On a normal weekday, I know that I have an assignment to teach. So if I\\u2019m not teaching the Primary, I might be teaching in Relief Society or I might be giving a talk. So whether I like it or not, I would have to prepare some way, somehow. Yes. And at work, we have devotionals, every Monday, where the whole workforce meets to share the gospel. So \\u2026 we meet every Monday morning, we pray. We sing, we pray and then we share a devotional message\\u2026. And then we start the day with it.\\n\\nAnd so every Monday, an individual has something to talk about at the devotional. You may not know who\\u2019s turn it is, so I strived, I ALWAYS strived to be on top of my game, to read my scriptures, to do all what I need to do to be spiritual, because you might never know when you\\u2019d be called upon. Yes, and I needed that, I needed the Spirit. I needed the promptings of the Spirit to do my work. I realize that when I focus on the Spirit, I am guided in what I do, I\\u2019m able to achieve more.\\n\\nBut when we were just in our home, and weren\\u2019t going to work, weren\\u2019t going to church, some way, somehow, I felt a little easy. I felt that there was no need to learn because I wasn\\u2019t going to teach. It was difficult, keeping my spirituality up. It was a tug of war. My mom would always say that we are being lazy. We need to do the Come Follow Me. At least our morning devotions, we should do that. It was, it was a struggle for us to maintain that. We\\u2019d do them but not as we were supposed to. And so our faith was lacking \\u2014 a lot. My faith was lacking a lot. I couldn\\u2019t keep up with my spiritual studies and all that\\u2026\\n\\nThe ministering \\\\[program\\\\] that was introduced was also helping a lot during those COVID times. Because you could minister by just using a telephone call to \\\\[say\\\\], \\u2018Hello, I was just calling to check up on you. How is the family?\\u2019 And there was WhatsApp internet, we could do a video call, you know. It was \\u2026 AMAZING. The way sisters called, the way the bishop called to always check up on the family. And so I think that is a plus for us \\u2014 the ministering, the new way of ministering  \\nthat we are doing.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 1: Mahana with children](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/01/Mahana-with-children.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 2: Mahana's boy](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/01/Mahana-boy.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Oral History of Mahana Delali Kodzo - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/mahana-kodzo/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: a black and white photo of a native american man](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/02/5e34b84153e53.image_.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/02/5e34b84153e53.image_.jpg)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 1870 (approximate)  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):** Apparel, Headdress  \\n**Object Material(s):** animal product, beads, fabric/cloth, feather  \\n**Provenience Nation:** United States Tribal Nations  \\n**Provenience Location:**  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:** 2020\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Relinquished\\n\\n**Nation:** United States Tribal Nations\\n\\n**Location:** Northern Arapaho Tribal Historic Preservation Office\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:** 1890 (approximate)\\n\\n**End Year:** 2020\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Gift from Black Coal himself\\n\\n**Nation:** United States\\n\\n**Location:** Private possession of Temple Smith in Massachusetts\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\n![Image 2: a black and white photo of a native american man](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/02/5e34b84153e53.image_-239x300.jpg)\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2020 (approximate)  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2020  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Sua sponte donation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Northern Arapaho Tribe  \\n**Complainant Nation:** United States Tribal Nations  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developing  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Temple Smith  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Private: Individual\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\\n\\nSupposedly, Temple Smith is the great-grandson of a dentist from Buffalo who travelled to the reservation to do work, and one of his patients, Black Coal, gifted him the headdress.

The positive psychology program at CGU was founded by the grandfather of Positive Psychology, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. At Claremont Graduate University, Positive Development is understood as individual growth through the lifespan. You\\u2019ll examine the positive developmental trajectories and processes that contribute to positive outcomes at both individual and sociocultural levels, integrating that knowledge with a background in evaluation and applied research methods. Led by expert faculty-scholars from both fields, you will continue the good work began by late Professor Csikszentmihalyi and gain experience applying social science concepts and methods to important social issues through research and practice, preparing you to succeed in an array of organizations and institutions and to make a lasting impact on the lives within them.\\n\\n##### Program Highlights\\n\\nOur programming in Positive Developmental Psychology is built upon the following core principles:\\n\\n*   The importance of understanding positive developmental processes and primary prevention, promotion, and optimization, rather than remediation.\\n*   The need to take into account inter-individual differences and intra-individual changes across the lifespan.\\n*   The centrality of context, especially institutions, settings, and programs that promote positive experiences and characteristics.\\n*   An appreciation of the bidirectional relationship between knowledge generation and knowledge application.\\n*   Promotion of applied research and evaluation so that our work has direct implications for the decisions of individuals, families, schools, practitioners, and policymakers.\\n*   This program is STEM designated, allowing international students who hold F-1 visas to apply for OPT work authorizations for a total of 36 months (an initial 1-year period and a 24-month OPT STEM extension) of paid work experience in the U.S. after graduation.\\n\\nProgram At-a-glance\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   MA in Psychology\\n    \\n    degree awarded\\n    \\n\\n*   Spring, Summer, Fall\\n    \\n    program start\\n    \\n*   2 years | full time\\\\*\\n    \\n    estimated completion time\\n    \\n\\nWhere You Can Find Our Alumni\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n*   First Five California\\n    \\n    Senior Research Analyst\\n    \\n*   University of Miami Linda Ray Center for Early Intervention Research\\n    \\n    Research Director in Psychology\\n    \\n*   California State University, Fullerton\\n    \\n    Assistant Professor\\n    \\n*   Children\\u2019s Institute International\\n    \\n    Program Analyst\\n    \\n*   UC Irvine Health Policy and Research Center\\n    \\n    Researcher\\n    \\n*   Claremont McKenna College, The Berger Institute for Work, Family, and Children\\n    \\n    Associate Director\\n    \\n*   Pomona College\\n    \\n    Visiting Assistant Professor of Psychology\\n    \\n*   Child Trends\\n    \\n    Research Scientist\\n    \\n*   United Way\\n    \\n    Data and Evaluation Manager\\n    \\n\\nFaculty\\n-------\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Positive Developmental Psychology and Evaluation - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"http://www.cgu.edu/academics/program/positive-developmental-psychology-evaluation/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Faculty\\n-------\\n\\n*   ![Image 2: Portrait of JEanne Nakamura](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/JeanneNakamura-web-e1478934838522-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Jeanne Nakamura\\n    \\n    Associate Professor  \\n    Director, Quality of Life Research Center\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Engagement, Mentoring, Positive Aging\\n    \\n*   ![Image 3: Portrait of Tiffany Berry](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TiffanyBerry-web-e1478931120222-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Tiffany Berry\\n    \\n    Dean, School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation  \\n    Full Research Professor\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Educational Program Evaluation, K\\u201312 Educational Curricula, Comprehensive School Reform\\n    \\n*   ![Image 4: Kendall Bronk](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kendall_Bronk_WEB-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Kendall Cotton Bronk\\n    \\n    Professor of Psychology\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Purpose in Life, Adolescent Moral Development, Positive Youth Development, Qualitative Methods\\n    \\n*   ![Image 5: Saeideh (Saida) Heshmati](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Heshmati1024x1024-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Saeideh (Saida) Heshmati\\n    \\n    Assistant Professor of Psychology\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Human Flourishing Across the Lifespan, Positive Relationships & Love, Longitudinal Analysis\\n    \\n\\nExtended Faculty\\n----------------\\n\\n*   #### Reed Larson\\n    \\n    University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Developmental experiences in youth programs\\n    \\n*   #### Stacey N.

Another book,\\u00a0_American Professors: A National Resource Imperiled,_ co-authored with Schuster, also received the Ness Book Award.\\n\\nIn tribute to Bowen following his death, Clark Kerr, former president of the University of California, described Bowen as \\u201cthe moral mentor for all of us\\u201d and \\u201cthe Chief Justice of American Higher Education.\\u201d\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"The Bowen Institute \\u00b7\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/center/the-bowen-institute/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Welcome to the Music Department\\n\\nThe Music Department offers courses of study leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Doctor of Musical Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy.\\n\\nAll programs are designed with an emphasis upon music within its interdisciplinary, cultural, and intellectual context.

In all of its efforts the Council strives to foster opportunities for exploration of the great scope and promise of Coptic studies as a realm of academic endeavor. The Council believes the benefits of these efforts will extend well beyond their Coptic roots, invigorating scholarship in such diverse areas of inquiry as New Testament studies, iconography, liturgy, ministry, patristics, monasticism, and sacred music.\\n\\nThe Council is committed to outreach through conferences, lectureships, and cultural events and supports its goals with an active capital development campaign. By drawing on the formidable intellectual resources of the Religion Department, its history of excellence in Coptic studies, and the rich cultural assets of the Coptic community, the Council hopes to cultivate a unique environment that will serve as a focal point for Coptic scholarship within the University and around the world. With the generous support of funding provided through a Challenge Grant via the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Council will be able to continue their invaluable research and scholarship endeavors.\\n\\nTo contribute to these goals, please [contact S.

Whether you are a PhD student writing a dissertation on Coptic monasticism, a college student taking a course in Art History, or a casual browser seeking intellectual nourishment, you will find the CCE to be an excellent resource.\\n\\nThe CCE will initially include approximately 2,800 articles published in The Coptic Encyclopedia (Aziz S. Atiya, ed. NY: Macmillan, 1991). The CCE will continuously add updates and new topics from the growing body of scholarship in Coptic studies at institutions worldwide. The scope of articles includes Coptic language and literature; Copto-Arabic literature; Coptic art, architecture, archaeology, history, music, liturgy, theology, spirituality, monasticism; and biblical, apocryphal, social, and legal texts.\\n\\nThe progress of the CCE project depends on the strength and continuity of Coptic Studies at CGU, the participation of scholars worldwide, and the availability of financial resources.\\n\\n**Courses**  \\nTaught by Professor Gawdat Gabra (Abdel-Sayed), the School of Religion has rich offering of courses in Coptic Studies.

Mr. Simpson's commitment to education has been steadfast\\u2014even during times of hardship.\\n\\nIn 1929, at a time when soup kitchens were the norm and unemployment was rampant, Mr. Simpson's parents found a way to cover the costs of their son's trombone lessons: paying them with groceries from the family business. \\\"That was a sacrifice for them to do that,\\\" he recalled.\\n\\nAfter completing his European tour of duty, Mr. Simpson\\u2014who was an undergraduate at the time he was asked to serve\\u2014was offered a post as a flight instructor. \\\"I said, 'No, thank you. I need to go back to school and finish my education.'\\\"\\n\\nIn 1950, Mr. Simpson and his wife were enrolled in a music school at the Palace of Fontainebleau, a picturesque French _ch\\u00e2teau_ located south of Paris that became a national museum, when they were left \\\"high and dry\\\" after all flights were diverted in the wake of North Korea's invasion of South Korea. They managed to secure passage on a ship, and\\u2014after weathering a storm, a slow ocean crossing, and bureaucratic delays\\u2014made it back home.\\n\\n\\\"We got back to school the day my teaching contract began,\\\" he recalled. \\\"We had no choice.\\\"\\n\\nCurrently a member of the Blaisdell Society, Mr. Simpson has included CGU in his estate to ensure his legacy will continue to have an impact on students' lives and experiences. His generosity will help provide our students with the tools and resources they will need to finish their educational journeys and meet the needs of a changing world.\\n\\n\\\"Claremont Graduate University represents education at a high level, which is something we all can appreciate,\\\" Mr. Simpson said. \\\"If you're a CGU graduate, then I think you have some obligation to try to help in whatever way you can.\\\"\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

This is because it is a relatively fast process to calculate the amount each student needs and allocate that amount from the total pool of funding available. It takes longer to match each student with a specific fellowship fund. During the academic year, as students are matched with fellowships, we inform them about the fellowship they received.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStewardship reporting letters are sent out on a rolling basis, with most endowed fellowship reports being sent in the fall semester. This allows time for the students to be matched with funds. Many prepare thank-you messages which are then forwarded to donors. If a student does not write a note, CGU sends the donor a report identifying a student recipient and, in the case of an endowed fellowship, information on the endowment\\u2019s performance.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWhenever possible, we try to continue a student\\u2019s association with the same fellowship from year to year. Students must continue to meet the criteria of the fellowship and be in good standing with the university in order to remain eligible. Because of the specifications of some fellowships, however, they may go to a new student each year.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIf no student meets the criteria for a specific fellowship, we may wait to award the fund, in case a student who fits the preference becomes eligible. By the end of the year, if no student has met the criteria, we will inform the donor of why this was the case.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn the case of an endowed fellowship, it is often awarded in the academic year following the year the pledge was completed so that the endowment has time to grow. However, please note that the first fellowship award depends on the timing of the gift.\\n\\nAn annual fellowship is generally awarded during the same academic year it was given but may also depend on the timing of the gift.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nDonors cannot select the recipients of their fellowships. Instead, qualified CGU staff choose the recipients based on the criteria set forth by the donor.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nEach year, CGU holds an annual fellowship luncheon in the spring. During this event, we make every effort to seat fellowship donors and their recipients at the same table. If this is not possible, you will be provided with an opportunity during the event to meet other student(s) who benefited from a named fellowship. Other opportunities to meet with the recipient(s) can usually be arranged upon request.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThere are two types of fellowships: endowed and annual. An endowed fellowship lives on in perpetuity as part of CGU\\u2019s endowment, and the growth and earnings on that fund are awarded to a student(s) based on the payout formula determined by the CGU Board of Trustees (currently 5 percent). An annual fellowship is one that can be given on a yearly basis to support a student or students. Both types are governed by criteria established by the donor. For example, we have fellowships that support female management students or African American students studying English.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThere are minimum amounts required to establish either an endowed fellowship or an annual fellowship. If you would like to learn more, please contact the Office of Planned Giving at 909-607-9224 or [plannedgiving@cgu.edu](mailto:plannedgiving@cgu.edu).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWe will be glad to assist you in developing fellowship criteria or in setting up any other aspects of fellowships.

My father named me Carter because like many Haitians, he loved things Americans. He immigrated to the United States shortly after my birth. For a long time, we lived with the thought that the makeshift boat he had embarked on had never made it. Little did he or I know that thirty-six years later I would locate him in Florida (I was on a summer seminar trip sponsored by BYU\\u2019s Wheatley Institution). He had left Haiti under the Papa Doc regime. With him gone, my mother took me out of the capital to be raised in a town about 45 minutes away. I grew up attending a Pentecostal Protestant church with her and eating every now and then food sacrificed to vodou gods. I never was a Vodou initiate, but I am very much aware of it since it was as much part of my everyday life as Christianity: I grew up with the idea that the world of spirits, all forms, was never too far; three of my relatives are Vodou priests, my grand-mother on my mother\\u2019s side had her gods and an altar in her house. Duty towards the gods and the gift to communicate with them and the other world supposedly run in the family, but you run no risk of being zombified by me: I have been as bad at taking care of them as I was good at eating their food. I regret the food wasted in sacrifices but my training in sociology of religion makes me appreciate great principles in them. And that training has helped me develop great respect for other religious practices or rituals as grounds upon which peoples approach religions that are foreign to them.\\n\\nA missionary asked me last week (2017) if I was married. I told him it had been 17 years, which triggered on his part, \\u201c17 years! How old are you!?\\u201d It\\u2019s been two years since. I may not look 40 but my birth certificate said that I was born in 1977. My kids are 15 (boy), 13 (boy), 7 (girl, yeah!) and the fourth (another girl, yeah!) is 2+. She has the attention of everyone at home. But she rewards us back with her smile; and her innocent efforts to emulate her older siblings and parents is always fun to watch and listen to.\\n\\nMy first contact with the Church was through a fireside on the \\u201cFirst Vision.\\u201d I was 18. Having been raised in a tradition of believers, whether it was Vodouism or Christianity, it made sense to me that God had not died and was not silent. That Joseph should see both him and Jesus Christ was totally normal to me. I was a \\u201cgolden\\u201d convert because I caught the fire during that fireside and it never stopped burning for me.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve experienced the Church in French Guyana (South America), in Haiti, Guadeloupe, St. Maarten, Guyana (the former British colony), in France, and in the United States. Generally, experienced leadership is more limited in places like Haiti, French Guyana, Guyana, St. Maarten and, to a lesser extent, Guadeloupe. But in all of those places, worship is more intense, there is more fervor than in the United States. Even in France you still find the convert or \\u201cpioneer\\u201d spirit that makes the members sing more than they do in any ward I\\u2019ve attended in the United States.\\n\\nI tend to think of myself as a socio-historian, a term used in some academic circles in France to refer to scholars who approach a research subject from a trans-disciplinary perspective. I am a certified teacher of English as a second language in the French educational system and I was a tenured teaching professor at Universit\\u00e9 Bordeaux Montaigne where I taught French/English translation, English applied to business and communication, American Studies and religion in international relations. My PhD is in American Studies and focused on the political integration of Mormons in the United States from Reed Smoot to Mitt Romney (2013). I left my position at Bordeaux Montaigne in 2018 to join the department of Church History and Doctrine at Brigham Young University.\\n\\nFrom my grand-father who raised me in small farms in Haiti, I learned to love living by the very first commandment ever given to mankind: as much as I love intellectual work, I\\u2019ll die if I don\\u2019t work with my hands building something or growing things (preferably not thorns and thistles) out of the earth by the sweat of my brow.\\n\\n![Image 1: Carter Charles](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2019/11/Carter-Charles-1z3gse5-768x1024.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Carter Charles - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/carter/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 2: Carter and his father](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2019/12/Carter-and-his-father-1024x814.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Carter Charles - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/carter/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Scholar Website Sign Up\\n-----------------------\\n\\nAfter creating your website, follow these **[Site Building Instructions](https://scholar.cgu.edu/site-building-instructions/)** to get started.\\n\\nCGU provides an easy way for students and faculty to create their own scholar websites using WordPress.

Sloper received her PhD in Positive Developmental Psychology and Evaluation from Claremont Graduate University in 2016. Her academic journey at CGU was shaped by an appreciation of the Positive Youth Development (PYD) perspective and the Applied Development Science (ADS) movement.\\n\\nSince starting evaluation work in 2009 as a CGU student, Sloper has served as Evaluation Project Manager, Principal Investigator (PI), or Co-PI for 30+ evaluation projects supervising teams of graduate students and professionals to conduct comprehensive evaluations with diverse program partners across the United States. These evaluations include national evaluations of several youth development initiatives, training and capacity building efforts, programs aiming to reduce hunger among children and college students, youth financial education programs, curriculum materials for middle and high school students, youth sports programming, and access and quality initiatives for early childhood education efforts. She possesses a particular expertise for evaluations of expanded learning programs (e.g., afterschool programs and outside-of-school-time \\\\[OST\\\\] programs).\\n\\nSloper strives to make evaluation useful for her organizational partners and responsive to their needs. Building collaborative relationships with youth-serving organizations is the first step in changing attitudes toward evaluation and promoting the value of evaluation as an important tool for decision-making and continuous quality improvement, as opposed to accountability.\\n\\nWhen Sloper is not at her desk, she enjoys being outside enjoying the majesty of small town Alaska (Haines, Alaska: population 2,600), paddle boarding with friends, reading fiction novels, listening to podcasts on long walks, spending time with her family (especially her four incredible nieces), and serving as a School Board Member for the Haines Borough School District. In 2017, Sloper was awarded the Alumni Emerging Leader Award from the University of Alaska Anchorage.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nBerry, T., Hite, B., Sloper, M., & Umans, H.

It is hypothesized that new interventions derived from basic research in cognitive neuroscience will show superior effects on preventive behavior over more traditional interventions.

On the other hand, there has been a widespread attempt in recent years to base all theology on (religious) experience; the Christian church celebrates God\\u2019s presence in its central sacraments of baptism and Eucharist; recent process thought has re-conceptualized God\\u2019s presence in panentheistic terms; and some have argued that God might be poly-present, not omnipresent.\\n\\nBut what does this mean? What does it mean to say that God is present or absent?

Thomas told his monks to avoid a sinful world by being hermetically sealed from it. He seemed to say that the world is so tempting that it can turn them (and us) into veritable addicts who eschew religion and spirituality.

When a distribution is made from your retirement plan account to a beneficiary, that person will owe federal income tax.\\n\\nConsider leaving your loved ones less heavily taxed assets and leaving your retirement plan assets to Claremont Graduate University to support our work. As a nonprofit organization, we are tax-exempt and will receive the full amount of what you designate to us from your plan. You can take advantage of this gift opportunity in the following ways:\\n\\n[Name us a beneficiary of your plan.](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/beneficiary-designations) This requires you to update your beneficiary designation form through your plan administrator. Here you can designate Claremont Graduate University as the primary beneficiary for a percentage or specific amount. You can also make us the contingent beneficiary so that we will receive the balance of your plan only if your primary beneficiary doesn't survive you.\\n\\n[With the IRA Charitable Rollover](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/ira-charitable-rollover), if you are 70\\u00bd years old or older, you can take advantage of a simple way to help those we serve and receive tax benefits in return. You can give up to $105,000 from your IRA directly to a qualified charity such as Claremont Graduate University without having to pay income taxes on the money.\\n\\n[Set up a charitable gift annuity](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-gift-annuities). If you are 70\\u00bd or older, you may now make a one-time election for a qualified charitable distribution of up to $53,000 (without being taxed) from your IRA to fund a life-income gift. This gift provides you (and a spouse, if you wish) with stable lifetime income that is unaffected by the markets. After your lifetime, the remainder of the gift annuity becomes your legacy at CGU. Some limitations apply, so contact us for more details and a personalized illustration at no obligation.\\n\\nFund a testamentary [charitable remainder trust](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-remainder-trusts). When you fund a charitable remainder trust with your heavily taxed retirement plan assets, the trust will receive the proceeds of your plan. The trust typically pays income to one or more named beneficiaries for life or for a set term of up to 20 years, after which the remaining assets in the trust would go to support Claremont Graduate University. This gift provides excellent tax and income benefits for you while supporting your family and our work.\\n\\n[A donor advised fund.](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/donor-advised-funds) When retirement plan assets pass to your heirs, distributions are taxed as ordinary income. This income tax burden can be substantial, greatly reducing the value of the intended gift. Instead, you can designate your donor advised fund as the beneficiary of all or a portion of your retirement plan assets. Your fund receives the full amount of the gift and bypasses any federal taxes.\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

The Drucker School\\u2019s location in Claremont, at the edge of the Inland Empire, puts us at the nexus of the largest logistics network in the United States and uniquely positions us to play a prominent role in developing supply chain innovators and leaders.\\n\\nLaunched at the 2015 Southern California Supply Chain Summit, the Center is partnering with leaders of business, government, trade, and policy organizations to enhance the performance of supply chains globally and the economic performance of the region. Drucker School has since formed early industry partnerships with Toyota and Disney, companies that provide access to exciting new approaches to supply chain and logistics. The center is also organizing a research agenda and program that will provide insights into the business, policy, and economic dimensions of supply management.\\n\\nThe Drucker School accepts applications from creative individuals and future leaders willing to tackle a complicated and growing industry in an environment built around academically rigorous coursework, top industry mentors, and interdisciplinary research. Applicants may apply for an MA or MBA with an emphasis in Supply Chain & Logistics. Additionally, the Center offers a competitive fellowship to women earning an MBA with a focus in Supply Chain & Logistics and offers female mentors to guide them through their education and beyond.\\n\\n##### Mission\\n\\nThe Drucker School of Management\\u2019s Center for Supply Chain & Logistics aims to develop and enhance effective leadership in the supply chain sector.\\n\\nThe Peter F. Drucker & Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management sits at the nexus of the largest logistics network in the United States. We are uniquely positioned to lead the southern California supply chain and logistics sectors, playing a prominent role in keeping northern California and rest of the country connected to the world. Evident from our vantage point are the challenges and opportunities of the supply chain that emerge from its complexity, dynamics, and scale. Part of the challenge is operational: how to make this complex network of production, transportation, and storage more efficient and effective. Part of the challenge is strategic: how to design a network that can anticipate and adapt to rising customer expectations, disruptive technologies, global developments and the advent of new business models. At the same time, due to its enormous footprint, the supply chain also has a significant impact on the well-being of society with a variety of attendant political and regulatory implications. The upside of addressing these challenges is the potential for a positive contribution to the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit that is unparalleled in the other sectors of the economy.\\n\\nGiven the importance of these challenges/opportunities, our proximity to the Southern California distribution system, and the unique intellectual assets contained within the Drucker School of Management and Claremont Graduate University (CGU), we are stepping forward to have a stronger voice in these matters through the establishment of a Center for Supply Chain & Logistics.\\n\\nThe Center for Supply Chain & Logistics will be the leader in supply chain research, graduate education, and productive discourse in Southern California. The Center will partner with leaders of business, government, and nonprofit organizations to enhance the economic and social performance of supply chains both locally and globally.\\n\\n##### Vision\\n\\n*   Be a conduit for the sharing of insights among practitioners and academics\\n*   Benchmark best practices\\n*   Conduct cutting-edge research in which objective answers are required\\n*   Equip today\\u2019s and tomorrow\\u2019s leaders with the skills, tools, and frameworks for effective decision making in the supply chain context\\n\\nThe Center builds upon the strengths of the Drucker School with its innovative teaching, quality applied research, and transdisciplinary approach to problem-solving that draws upon the full resources of CGU.\\n\\n##### Investing in Leaders of the 21st Century Supply Chain\\n\\nThe Center for Supply Chain & Logistics aims to develop and enhance effective leadership in the supply chain sector. The Center will achieve this by offering a rich mix of programs, forums, and courses that focus on the top issues facing supply chains and their constituent entities. To properly address these issues, supply chain leaders need certain skills and abilities that are common to all fields: foresight, self-management, communication of purpose, integration of diversity, systems thinking, etc. We teach those skills and abilities in our for-credit and executive education courses today and plan to do so in future supply chain offerings. However, we also believe that the complex nature of supply chains necessitates a multi-dimensional perspective and approach as depicted in the figure below.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Center for Supply Chain & Logistics \\u00b7\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/center/center-for-supply-chain-and-logistics/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Responsible Management recognizes the importance of the bottom line as a by-product of doing the right things right. This perspective draws heavily on the principles and values of Peter Drucker, which stress customer and employee focus, social responsibility, fostering innovation, and achieving financial results. Public policy shapes the supply chain environment and can be either an enabler or inhibitor of progress. Balanced Public Policy recognizes the co-existence of goals related to economic growth/jobs, sustainability, quality of life, health/safety, etc., and neglects none. Analytic & Technical Competence refers to the sophisticated use of data to make decisions and optimize performance: big data/data mining, location analytics/GIS, RFID, simulation, etc.\\n\\nThe supply chain will prosper to the extent that its leaders can (collectively) effectuate a high degree of overlap among these three circles. For example, the intersection of Responsible Management and Balanced Public Policy is very much about public-private collaboration. Although achieving that collaboration can be a difficult hurdle, there are success stories and road maps to follow. With respect to the overlaps of Analytic & Technical Competence and the other two circles, the question becomes: \\u201cWhat do the data say should be done?\\u201d Evidence-based decision making is well entrenched in the management fields and is the preferred approach in the policy realm as well.\\n\\nPut figuratively, the primary aim of the Center is to enlarge and integrate the three circles in the supply chain context. To help accomplish that aim, the Center will partner closely with CGU\\u2019s School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation, CGU\\u2019s Center for Information Systems & Technology, and the Center\\u2019s affiliated organizations.\\n\\n##### Activity Portfolio\\n\\nThe activity portfolio of the Center is decidedly practice-oriented and is designed to build a knowledge base for effective action, promote dialogue among the relevant supply chain stakeholder groups, find solutions to specific problems, and increase the bench strength of leaders who can advance the sector and its economic and societal contribution.\\n\\n**Knowledge Creation**\\n\\n*   Create and maintain a mechanism for environmental scanning that is capable of identifying emerging trends and technological developments that have the potential to reshape the supply chain industry.\\n*   Hold an annual symposium of academics, supply chain professionals, government officials and not-for-profit executives to distill a set of publishable research priorities around the industry\\u2019s key challenges and opportunities.\\n*   Provide thought leadership and direction on critical supply chain issues by conducting primary research, bench-marking studies, collecting case histories, and synthesizing prescriptive frameworks.\\n*   Attract world-class talent to the Drucker School/CGU (in the roles of faculty, executives-in-residence, visiting fellows, speakers, etc.) with deep expertise in areas crucial to the supply chain industry.\\n\\n**Knowledge Sharing**\\n\\n*   Disseminate results and insights through a variety of channels including reports, working papers, journal articles, books, blogs, webinars, news releases, special events, etc.\\n*   In concert with affiliated organizations and sponsors, hold the premier supply chain conference in Southern California, featuring prominent experts, executives, policymakers, and organizations.\\n*   Orchestrate customized think tanks and dialogue platforms that bring together thought leaders and senior executives for an in-depth exploration of specific issues.\\n*   Build executive peer networks that provide a platform for an ongoing exchange of conceptual frameworks and practical solutions.\\n*   Provide C-level briefings and strategic advisory services designed to contextualize insights from research and practice, thus providing tangible and actionable perspectives for transformational change initiatives.\\n*   Establish a virtual platform that serves as a hub for a global community of supply chain stakeholders, including a blog, discussion boards, content channels, a case \\u201clibrary,\\u201d webinars, downloadable data, and more.\\n\\n**Creative Problem Solving**\\n\\n*   Foster public-private collaboration on critical supply chain issues through facilitated forums and summits among leaders of the various stakeholder groups.\\n*   For individual and consortia of member organizations, conduct applications-oriented research and consulting projects that are capable of providing proprietary information and recommendations as well as public record findings.\\n*   Identify/develop/adapt software solutions that facilitate knowledge management, collaboration, and evidenced-based decision making in a supply chain context.\\n\\n**Education and Professional Development**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Center for Supply Chain & Logistics \\u00b7\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/center/center-for-supply-chain-and-logistics/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Education and Professional Development**\\n\\n*   Provide a flow of master\\u2019s degree graduates who possess the requisite skills and knowledge to move the supply chain industry forward by virtue of their coursework, experiential learning opportunities, and internship experiences.\\n*   Afford practicing supply chain professionals the chance to upgrade their skills and knowledge base through certificate and short-course programs delivered face-to-face and/or online.\\n*   Offer both public and custom executive education programs (including seminars, workshops and learning expeditions) aimed at supply chain managers/directors who are poised to move into organizational leadership positions.\\n\\n##### Women in Supply Chain\\n\\nThe Drucker Center for Supply Chain & Logistics, in partnership with Toyota, aims to meet the need for more women leaders in the supply chain with the Toyota Women of Achievement Scholars program.\\n\\nThis fellowship prepares women to be the next generation of supply chain leaders and managers by providing them with education in the latest trends, practices, and innovations in supply chain management and logistics.

Across all racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., young adults have among the highest rates of tobacco use. Yet, to date, they remain largely understudied and, as a result, present unique challenges to the development of effective methods to quit tobacco use. To our knowledge, scientifically-based programs developed specifically to help young adult South Asian populations quit tobacco use do not exist.\\n\\nOver the two years of this proposed project, we will establish a community-university collaboration to study tobacco use among 176 Bangladeshi, Indian, Nepali, and Pakistani current and former tobacco users between 18 and 29 years of age. Utilizing in-depth interviews, focus groups, surveys, and real time data collection using cell phones, we will identify the cultural, social, environmental, and intrapersonal factors that impact smoking and quitting behaviors among our South Asian participants. We will disseminate our findings to South Asian communities through community meetings, webinars and other web-based distribution methods and to external audiences through scientific meetings and publications.\\n\\nUltimately, our study results will inform the development of future cessation strategies uniquely suited to young adult South Asians in the U.S. The proposed pilot is directly relevant to the California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program research mission in that it addresses one of its primary areas of research, namely, prevention and cessation of tobacco use among California\\u2019s diverse populations.\\n\\nInvestigators\\n-------------\\n\\n**Paula H.

Native Hawaiians are those with ancestry to the indigenous people of the Hawaiian Islands. There are 140,652 Native Hawaiians living in the United States, and Southern California is home to 20,571 Native Hawaiians. Over 50% held at least a high school degree, compared to 20% of the US population, and only 2,393 earned a bachelor\\u2019s degree or higher and 2,203 Native Hawaiians in California are living below the poverty level (factfinder.census.gov, 2000).\\n\\nWith regards to cancer health disparities, a study of Native Hawaiians in Hawaii found that 64% of Native Hawaiians were obese compared to only 29% in the U.S. population (Curb et al., 1991; Mokuau et al., 1995). Rates of prostate cancer among Native Hawaiians and Samoans rose from 140 to 175 per 100,000 during the 1990s then remained steady through 2006. Rates of uterine cancer among native Hawaiians and Samoans spiked from 30 to 90 per 100,000 in the 1990s then dropped to 60 in 2001-2006 (L. A. Cancer Surveillance Program, 2009). According to Miller et al. (2008) Native Hawaiians in the U.S. had a breast cancer incidence of 175.8 per 100,000, which was significantly higher than that found among non-Hispanic Whites (145.2 per 100,000), and mortality of 33.5 per 100,000, compared to 27.8 per 100,000 for non-Hispanic whites (Miller). Nearly 40% of Native Hawaiian breast cancers in the U.S. were detected at the regional or distant stage, and over 50% of cervical cancers were detected at the regional or distant stage (Miller). In Hawai\\\\`i, Native Hawaiian women have the highest mortality rates for cancer of the breast (38 per 100,000) compared to the general population (22.5 per 100,000 for breast) (Gotay). Epidemiological information for Pacific Islanders on the continental U.S. mirror Hawai\\\\`i; for instance, a study conducted in Orange County found that the odds for breast cancer incidence among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders was almost 2.3 times that of non-Hispanic whites (Marshall). Later cancer diagnosis stages for Pacific Islanders account for much of the disparities in their survival. According to Marshall and colleagues (2008), Orange County Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders were over 2.4 times more likely to have later stages of breast cancer diagnosis (6). In a 2006 cervical and breast cancer knowledge and screening study (Tran et al.), of 157 Native Hawaiian women only 46.5% of women in the study were able to accurately describe screening procedures for cervical and breast cancer.\\n\\nIn September of 2013, the Cancer Prevention Institute of California published cancer incidence trends among Native Hawaiians between the years of 1990 and 2008. Among Native Hawaiian males, the top five diagnosed cancers were prostate, lung, colon/rectum, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and stomach cancer. All five types were observed to have decreasing rates over the 19-year period. Despite a 0.4 percent decrease annually, prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer.  \\nWithin the Native Hawaiian female population, the top five diagnosed cancers were breast, lung, uterine corpus, colon/rectum and pancreas. Both breast and lung cancer rates were observed to increase during the first half of the 19-year period and a decrease in the latter half. Cancer of the uterine corpus decreased by 2.7 percent annually, while colon/rectum and pancreatic cancer rates remained stable.\\n\\n| Cancer Incidence Rate Percent Change  \\n(% per Year)\\n |\\n| --- |\\n| _Native Hawaiian_ | Male | Female |\\n| Prostate | \\\\-0.4%\\n\\n |  |\\n| Lung | \\\\-2.3%\\n\\n | \\\\-6.4%1\\n\\n |\\n| Colon/rectum | \\\\-0.9%\\n\\n | No change\\n\\n |\\n| NHL | \\\\-1.0%\\n\\n |  |\\n| Stomach | \\\\-3.8%\\n\\n |  |\\n| Breast |  | \\\\-4.1%2\\n\\n |\\n| Uterine corpus |  | \\\\-2.7%\\n\\n |\\n| Pancreas |  | No change\\n\\n |\\n| 1since 2002  \\n2since late nineties |\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Native Hawaiian \\u2014 Weaving an Islander Network for Cancer Awareness, Research, and Training\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/wincart/communities/native-hawaiian/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"|\\n| 1since 2002  \\n2since late nineties |\\n\\nSource: [CPIC Native Hawaiian Cancer Factsheet:](http://www.cpic.org/files/PDF/Cancer_Registry/Fact_Sheets/Native_Hawaiian_Cancer_Fact_Sheet.pdf)  \\n**Pacific Islander Health Partnership (PIHP):** **PIHP** is a nonprofit collaborative of community and faith\\u2013based organizations serving Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders \\u201cto reduce health disparities through education, training, advocacy, building island community capacity for health\\u201d.

The Information Systems & Technology program offers aid for both domestic and international students in the form of fellowships, which are competitive and merit based and reduce the total cost of tuition.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe application process for international students is the same for domestic applicants. Prospective students can submit their online application to CGU at admissions.cgu.edu/apply with the required $80 application fee. You will need to complete/provide:\\n\\n*   Online application\\n*   Application fee\\n*   Current resume or curriculum vitae (CV)\\n*   Statement of purpose\\n*   Official transcripts from all degree-granting institutions\\n*   2 official letters of recommendation (professional or academic)\\n*   Official GRE or GMAT scores (where applicable)\\n*   TOEFL, IELTS, or Pearson PTE scores (for international applicants)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNo. While a 3.0 GPA or higher (out of 4.0) is a good baseline to assess overall competitiveness, rather than examine overall GPA, we look mainly at performance levels in courses that are most relevant in the Information Systems & Technology program.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe GRE/GMAT test score is optional for applicants to Master\\u2019s level degrees in Information Systems & Technology and required for applicants to the PhD in Information Systems & Technology. All applicants are encouraged to submit a GRE/GMAT test score to strengthen their application.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes, GRE/GMAT waivers are granted on a case by case basis for PhD program applicants with eight or more years of related professional experience. To be eligible for GRE/GMAT waiver consideration, applicants must submit a complete application with resume included that has clear start/end months and years for all positions held and job titles, and contains a detailed description of duties for each position. Applicants should also notify the Office of Admissions of their request for a GRE/GMAT waiver consideration (via email) upon submission of the online application.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nClaremont Graduate University (CGU) accepts applications on a rolling basis and operates on a priority deadline cycle. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit complete applications by the priority dates in order to assure maximum consideration for both admission and fellowships. Official versions of\\u00a0all required application materials must be received before the priority deadline for your application to be to be reviewed.

The time required to complete the PhD program can range from 60 to 84 months, depending on course enrollment and time required to complete the dissertation.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes. Many students in our program are working professionals who study part-time. There is no difference between part-time or full-time students except for the number of classes the student chooses to enroll in per semester.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStudents cannot transfer any units into the MS program. Doctoral students may transfer up to 24 approved graduate units into the PhD program.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNo. An internship is not required, but is strongly recommended during the summer or while in the program after your first semester, especially for students with limited work experience. The Office of Career Development works closely with students to help prepare them for their internship searches. Internships can be non-credit or taken as a field study, which may apply toward the practicum requirement upon prior approval.\\n\\n* * *\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"FAQ - Center for Information Systems & Technology - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/school/center-for-information-systems-and-technology/faq/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"* * *\\n\\nThere are limited positions to work with professors as research or teaching assistants, and competition for them is strong.

The center was co-founded by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Jeanne Nakamura who is the current director.\\n\\nIn the past, the study of behavior has focused mainly on what goes wrong in human affairs: aggression, mental disease, failure, and hopelessness. Although it is essential to study and address such pathologies, it is equally important to understand those aspects of human experience that make life worth living. The QLRC conducts research on such issues and provides a forum for scholars from the United States and abroad who wish to extend their studies in positive psychology.\\n\\nCGU\\u2019s graduate programs in Positive Psychology were launched in fall 2007 through the School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation, Division of Behavioral & Organizational Sciences, and Department of Psychology. The PhD programs in Positive Organizational Psychology and Positive Developmental Psychology provide research training in positive psychology. MA concentrations in Evaluation and either Positive Organizational Psychology or Positive Developmental Psychology are also offered.\\n\\n##### Research\\n\\nIn response to the dramatic changes in longevity worldwide, the QLRC is pursuing research on social innovation and good work in the second half of life as well as the study of everyday life, using experience sampling methods. Recent research projects have examined how good mentors develop in a variety of professions, supported by a grant from the Spencer Foundation, and studied how well-being is defined in various cultures as part of the cross-national Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation. Other studies underway concern the restoration of a stable society in South American countries recovering from civil war as well improving coaching strategies in professional sports.\\n\\nWith the help of grants from the Fetzer, Ford, Hewlett, Spencer, and Templeton Foundations, the QLRC has conducted research jointly with Harvard and Stanford Universities on the conditions that enable good work in the professions. Areas investigated included business, human genetics, media, philanthropy, and higher education. Findings are used to enhance professional training in these areas.\\n\\nThe center welcomes inquiries about collaboration on projects in line with its basic mission.\\n\\nIf you are interested in being a participant in studies conducted by the center, please [email us](mailto:qlrc.research@cgu.edu).\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Quality of Life Research Center \\u00b7\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/qlrc/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"\\u201cI have really enjoyed all the hands-on experience that I\\u2019ve had on the Regional Learning Collaborative team, including project management, educational research, writing newsletters, and seeing everything from the ground up.

The answer shouldn't surprise you, authors say.\\n\\n_Editor\\u2019s Note: CGU prides itself on being a small, close-knit academic community that nurtures strong collaborations between professors and students. Nothing better demonstrates this than the work of Drucker Professor Bernie Jaworski with former student Virginia Cheung. In Cheung\\u2019s dissertation topic, which brings together the philosophies of Peter Drucker, Confucius, and the management styles of contemporary companies, Jaworski saw an opportunity for Cheung to publish a book that would help her establish her professional brand in the management field. The following is adapted from that new book._\\n\\nWhy is it so important to specify a company\\u2019s vision? Isn\\u2019t a mission statement enough? Not exactly. Like any key organizational metric, unless we specify a clear objective\\u2014or end-state\\u2014we have no way of charting progress on our mission.\\n\\nPepsi\\u2019s stated mission, for instance, is to \\u201ccreate more smiles with every sip and bite.\\u201dHowever, their vision focuses on something else to achieve this mission: to be the global leader in convenient foods and beverages by winning with a purpose. Here, captured by this seemingly simple statement, is their ambition to win sustainably in the marketplace, accelerate top-line growth, and, at the same time, make a commitment to do good for the planet and communities. The end-state\\u2014which is being the global leader\\u2014is a very clear articulation of their desire to be number one and, thus, beat out their major competitor, the Coca-Cola Company.\\n\\nIt may seem straightforward, but many business leaders find that developing a vision statement is very challenging. Why? Because it\\u2019s often difficult to get the organization to commit to a very specific target goal. It is much easier to make general statements instead: The company, for instance, desires to end poverty or be a \\u201chigh-performing\\u201d organization. These generalized statements are fine, but they do not provide the same level of urgency or motivation that a specific number or target does.\\n\\nIdentifying a specific target by a specific date creates another challenge for the company: It means it must publicly commit to these goals, and making that commitment means risking publicly failing to reach them. As such, the organization can lose face. One final obstacle to crafting a vision statement is the simple fact that the executive leadership team may have very different views of what it means to achieve the company\\u2019s mission.\\n\\nGetting It Right\\n----------------\\n\\nCollectively, these challenges decrease the chances of creating a clear end-state for the organization. Our remedy is to focus on six key characteristics that are true for some of the best company vision statements.\\n\\nArticulate a Clear \\u201cEnd-State\\u201d\\n------------------------------\\n\\nWhat will the world look like when we are done and have accomplished our goal? The vision statement provides an answer for the company\\u2019s workforce.\\n\\nSome organizations avoid committing to a specific target. Take, for example, SAP, the German multinational enterprise software firm. Their explicit vision is to \\u201chelp the world run better and improve people\\u2019s lives.\\u201d\\u00a0Not only is the target end-state imprecise, but it\\u2019s also equally unclear what the firm does for a living. Is this an athletic shoe firm? A transportation and logics firm? A health care firm?\\n\\nCreate a Statement in One Concise Sentence\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nMarriott International manages more than 20 well-known hotel brands, including Marriott, the W Hotel, Westin, Sheraton, Ritz-Carlton, and Le Meridian. Its vision statement is quite simple: to be the World\\u2019s Favorite Travel Company.\\u201d The term \\u201cfavorite\\u201d is an excellent word choice since it is defined as \\u201cpreferred before all others of the same kind.\\u201d Thus, the company intends to be the top choice among all other competitors in the specific markets it serves. So, for the Ritz Carlton, it means to be the top choice relative to the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental. For Westin, it means to be favored over Hilton. Thus, even though it is somewhat broad, Marriott\\u2019s vision statement can be easily translated to the circumstances of each of its divisions.\\n\\nUse Image-Based Language\\n------------------------\\n\\nCompared to more abstract language, image-based language engages employee emotions and provides a shared point of reference. Being very clear about the desired long-term outcome reflects the idea that the vision is a clear, specific picture of an ideal future. For a watch company, for example, a clear picture could be evoked with a statement such as \\u201ca watch on every person\\u2019s arm.\\u201d It is easy to visualize this statement as compared with some vague appeal to excellent customer service.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Do Companies Need Vision Statements? \\u2014 The Flame\", \"source\": \"https://flame.cgu.edu/do-companies-need-vision-statements/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Inspire Your Workforce\\n----------------------\\n\\nA great vision\\u2014much like a great mission\\u2014must inspire, motivate, and energize the company\\u2019s workforce. It should make employees proud to be part of the organization. For example, a firm in the transportation sector might focus on a message of being safe and reliable (so that everyone can get home and spend more time with their loved ones). In contrast, another firm working with consumer-packaged goods presents a message of providing the best quality food and still enhancing the planet\\u2019s sustainability. Vision statements should be crafted to inspire and drive the workforce to achieve as much as possible.\\n\\nGive Challenging but Achievable Goals\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nVision end-states are often \\u201cstretch goals,\\u201d which means that they can be achieved if the organization is highly focused, works hard, and is committed to the task at the end. However, these goals are hard to attain and require an unusual level of commitment from everyone.\\n\\nBe Distinct from Your Competitors\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nDeveloping great strategy means developing value propositions that your competitors cannot match. Thus, one should aim for a distinctive vision statement\\u2014not one that your competitors could comfortably claim. For instance, Deloitte\\u2019s vision to be the standard of excellence, the first choice of the most sought-after clients and talent, is not very distinctive or unique: PWC or KPMG could easily say the exact same thing.\\n\\nVision Statements: Some Examples\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nWith those criteria in mind, we discuss some vision statements that are great or could be improved.\\n\\n_IKEA_\\n------\\n\\n\\u201c_Our vision is to create a better everyday life for the many people \\u2013 for customers, but also for our co-workers and the people who work at our suppliers.\\u201d_\\n\\nThere are several aspects of global Swedish conglomerate IKEA\\u2019s vision statement that are noteworthy.\\n\\nThis statement is challenging but clearly achievable. Since it is about improving the lives of individuals around the world, it is inspirational for the workforce. It is often presented as one sentence \\u201cCreate a better every day for all people impacted by our business.\\u201d One can imagine what a \\u201cbetter every day\\u201d can look like for customers\\u2014they enjoy their home furnishings, appliances, and accessories. It is distinct from competitors in the furniture business.\\n\\nThe one issue that concerns us is the lack of specification of the end goal. What does the world \\u201clook like\\u201d when they\\u2019ve achieved their goal? Given that they have nearly 800 million store visits globally, one could argue that their vision statement should have a numeric target. Perhaps something like: We aim to improve the lives of over 1 billion people per year.\\n\\n_Habitat for Humanity_\\n----------------------\\n\\n_\\u201cA world where everyone has a decent place to live.\\u201d_\\n\\nHabitat for Humanity stacks up well against our six criteria. First, there is an end state that focuses on everyone in the world. The statement is just ten words but sends a powerful message about achieving its mission. One can easily visualize the end outcome: a home for every person.\\n\\n_Toyota_\\n--------\\n\\n_\\u201cToyota will lead the future mobility society, enriching lives around the world with the safest and most responsible ways of moving people.\\u201d_\\n\\nToyota is one of the largest automobile companies in the world. Sales revenue exceeded $275 billion in 2020. It is frequently on the list of best places to work and most admired companies. It was one of the first firms to move into the hybrid electric vehicle market aggressively.\\n\\nWhat we find so interesting in the vision statement is the notion that Toyota will lead the future of a mobile society and find the best and most responsible ways to \\u201cmove people\\u201d around. Notice that they do not say automobile company but instead focus on \\u201cmoving people.\\u201d Indeed, they do not even say transportation company, which suggests a shift away from vehicles to other modes still to be imagined. This vision statement clearly embraces a future orientation\\u2014and that\\u2019s very challenging. While it is achievable, we also believe that more tangible, focused imagery would bring this statement to life.\\n\\nAssess Your Organization\\u2019s Vision Statement\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nLike mission and purpose statements, the vision statement should be driven from the top of the organization\\u2014with input from all ranks of employees. It should be \\u201ctested\\u201d with all key stakeholders, particularly key customers and partners.\\n\\nAs you evaluate your organization\\u2019s vision statement, remember these questions:\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Do Companies Need Vision Statements? \\u2014 The Flame\", \"source\": \"https://flame.cgu.edu/do-companies-need-vision-statements/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"As you evaluate your organization\\u2019s vision statement, remember these questions:\\n\\n*   Does our vision statement have a clear, specific end-state or goal?\\n*   Is our vision statement one or two sentences in length?\\n*   Can our employees and other key stakeholders \\u201cvisualize\\u201d the desired end goal?\\n*   Is the vision statement challenging \\u2013 but attainable?\\n*   Does it inspire key stakeholders \\u2013 most notably your employees?\\n*   Finally, is our vision statement different from our competitors\\u2019?\\n\\nVision statements go hand-in-hand with mission statements. They help rally the organization and energize its workforce to come to work every day and stay focused on turning that exciting end-target into a reality.

The views represented below are their own._\\n\\nAbout a month ago, the Claremont Mormon Studies Student Association (CMSSA) had the opportunity to host a lunch meeting with BYU political philosophy professor Ralph Hancock. In preparation for our conversation, we were sent Hancock\\u2019s _Times and Seasons_\\u00a0[blog posts](http://timesandseasons.org/index.php/2012/07/nothing-to-apologize-for-part-ii/)\\u00a0regarding Mormon Studies. Yet, perusing those posts, we found that the Mormon Studies about which Hancock expressed great caution did not seem to match up with our scholarship here at Claremont. Over lunch we ended up disagreeing with some of Hancock\\u2019s conclusions about the nature of Mormon Studies and had a lively discussion. Fortunately, however, through the course of our conversation we discovered that some of his caution was about belief in absolute academic objectivity, which we, as scholars, certainly share.\\n\\nWe also learned that the model of Mormon Studies from which Ralph Hancock 556c was working was presented in the article \\u201cWhere is the \\u2018Mormon\\u2019 in \\u2018Mormon Studies\\u2019?\\u201d, written by former Claremont student Loyd Ericson and published in the first and only issue of the Claremont Journal of Mormon Studies.[1](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/#fn1-21 \\\"Loyd Ericson, \\u201cWhere is the \\u2018Mormon\\u2019 in Mormon Studies?\\u201d, Claremont Journal of Mormon Studies 1, no. 1 (2011.)\\u00a0This journal was priorly archived on the Claremont Mormon Studies website. With a recent revamping of the website, it became unavailable; those interested can access the journal issue\\u00a0here.\\\")\\u00a0Most of us had not read this article prior to the lunch and dashed to it only afterward. As Hancock\\u2019s attention to the article demonstrated, it was easily associated with Claremont and the program of which we are a part, meaning that we have academic, institutional, and personal interests in responding to it.\\n\\nIn this post, we would like to summarize Ericson\\u2019s arguments and push back against aspects we find problematic; in a second post, coming Wednesday, we will present an alternative view. In so doing, we hope to highlight to the public the multivocality of Mormon Studies both at Claremont and in general.\\n\\nEricson starts by spelling out some of the fundamental questions regarding the identity of \\u201cMormon Studies\\u201d \\u2013 for example, whether the \\u201cMormon\\u201d refers to the scholars\\u2019 religion, the object(s) of study, or a unique discipline altogether. The identification of these questions provide a useful grounding on which to base a more rigorous and comprehensive definition of Mormon Studies; however, we believe problems arise in the answers Ericson gives to them.\\n\\nFirst, to address whether the \\u201cMormon\\u201d in Mormon Studies describes\\u2013somehow\\u2013the practitioners of Mormon Studies, Ericson identifies \\u201csix different groups that participants in Mormon Studies tend to be categorized into\\u201d: \\u201cpastoral\\u201d Mormons, Mormon apologists, \\u201cMormons, but,\\u201d \\u201cnon-Mormons, but,\\u201d \\u201cMormon revisionists,\\u201d and anti-Mormons.[2](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/#fn2-21 \\\"Ibid., 6-8.\\\")\\u00a0Taking seriously his assumption that all these groups do, indeed, participate in Mormon Studies, we find his categories to be highly problematic and his \\u201cbuts\\u201d especially so. To explain his use of this conjunction, Ericson gives the following examples:\\n\\n_\\u201cShe is a Mormon, but she is not an apologist.\\u201d_\\n\\n_\\u201cHe is a believing Mormon, but he doesn\\u2019t let that affect his scholarship.\\u201d_\\n\\n_\\u201cShe is a Mormon, but she hides it well in her work.\\u201d[3](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/#fn3-21 \\\"Ibid., 7.\\\")_\\n\\nAs noted, the \\u201cbut\\u201d is also used to describe non-Mormons:\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Examining the \\u201cMormon\\u201d in \\u201cMormon Studies\\u201d \\u2013 Part 1 of 2 - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"_\\u201cShe is a non-Mormon, but she isn\\u2019t anti-Mormon.\\u201d_\\n\\n_\\u201cHe is a non-Mormon, but he has a real interest in objectively studying Mormonism.\\u201d_\\n\\n_\\u201cShe is a non-Mormon, but she is not attempting to disprove Mormonism.\\u201d[4](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/#fn4-21 \\\"Ibid., 8.\\\")_\\n\\nWhile we acknowledge that these categories may reflect how non-Mormon and Mormon scholars of Mormonism are commonly discussed by their publics, we feel that that the colloquiality that has made these \\u201cbut\\u201d classifications common in usage is partially what makes them unfitting for academic discourse. The \\u201cbuts\\u201d only serve a purpose if certain assumptions are made about the radical incompatibility of religious belief (or the lack thereof) and scholarship. In the case of \\u201cMormon, but,\\u201d using the term denotes (intentionally or not) a certain skepticism of whether a Mormon can conduct scholarship that is, to quote Ericson, \\u201ca descriptive and academically accepted understanding of Mormonism that does not evangelize or offer apologies for religious beliefs.\\u201d[5](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/#fn5-21 \\\"Ibid., 7-8.\\\")\\u00a0It also implies that if a scholar lets slip that she is Mormon, her scholarship is now reasonably suspect as apologetics or evangelizing, even if it does nothing of the sort. While this distinction might be useful in addressing popular perceptions of Mormon scholars, it is inappropriate and, we would argue, misleading when applied to a discussion of Mormon Studies, as it diverts attention to the identity politics of scholarship rather than to scholars\\u2019 work. It also presumes the objective correctness of the radical privatization and bracketing of religion in public discourse \\u2013 something about which Hancock, we believe, is justifiably wary. As scholars, we should be uniquely suspicious of assertions or assumptions of objectivity.\\n\\nConversely, the category of \\u201cnon-Mormon, but\\u201d makes some equally unflattering assumptions. It seems to cast the default position of non-Mormons as anti-Mormon and asks them to in some way prove that they are worthy of doing Mormon Studies. We acknowledge that there are definite historical and cultural factors at play in Mormon suspicion of non-Mormon scholarship about the community; ingroups, with good reason, look askance at outgroup scrutiny. Further, non-Mormon scholars almost always face a steep learning curve that their Mormon compatriots (immersed as they are in a distinct oral and experiential culture) do not, which without careful scholarship could lead to avoidable errors. But we would argue that it is unfruitful to transfer historical suspicion of non-Mormons addressing Mormon matters into the realm of academics and Mormon Studies. Furthermore, other disciplines face similar problems (consider non-Muslims doing Islamic Studies, or non-Jews studying Judaism), but those problems have not been anywhere near fatal. If we are truly seeking to establish a new, open discipline, reiteration of past debates should be relegated to the historiography of the discipline, not its ontology. Instead of crystallizing or rehashing old worries, we can try to forge a new path.\\n\\nEricson\\u2019s article posits pastoral and apologetic as categories strictly demarcated from \\u201cMormons, but\\u201d and \\u201cnon-Mormons, but,\\u201d but does not interrogate the exact distinctions between them. The distinction between the \\u201cbuts\\u201d and his revisionist and anti-Mormon categories is similarly nebulous. This is an area we will explore further in our second post; we feel that these are valid categories, but they require a deeper degree of examination than Ericson supplies.\\n\\nAdditional segments of Ericson\\u2019s paper, in turn, address questions of Mormon methodology and whether the \\u201cMormon\\u201d in Mormon Studies refers to the identity of the practitioners thereof. Ericson dismisses the concept of a unique Mormon methodology by reducing the question to academically unacceptable testimony and ends with a peculiar musing that articles written by Mormon scholars on philosophy which do not engage with Mormonism might still be considered \\u201cMormon Studies.\\u201d[6](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/#fn6-21 \\\"Ibid., 10-12.\\\")\\n\\n* * *\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Examining the \\u201cMormon\\u201d in \\u201cMormon Studies\\u201d \\u2013 Part 1 of 2 - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"* * *\\n\\n1.

She minored in economics and holds an MBA. And as a former bank executive who focused on market research, it may seem odd to see Stone now pursuing a Master of Fine Arts. But rather than abandoning her former mode of thinking in pursuit of a new one, Stone applies mathematical and statistical models to her art.\\n\\n\\\"Every time we create a statistic, we are making a generalization about something that ignores specifics. The cost of this is that the information, by the process of collation, is sterilized, and the human element is lost. By painting these models, my goal is to reanimate that data but in a different form, to reinfuse it with a human principle,\\\" said Stone.\\n\\nStone's art represents the intersection of the analytical and the metaphysical. Typically combining three elements\\u2014a color, a body of statistics, and a random signifier\\u2014 and using both formalist and conceptual\\u2014or interpretive\\u2014techniques, she aims to create meaning where connections aren't ordinarily made.\\n\\nOn December 14, 2012 a mass shooting took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. As information slowly trickled out on the news wires, Stone sensed an unsettling emphasis on the shooter. And that following Monday, when Stone finally got information about the victims, she found it in the form of a spreadsheet that listed only the children's names, ages, and genders.\\n\\nThis led her to question how society processes tragic news: By containing and rationalizing information, is it easier to process grief? By creating a summary of something, is it somehow more manageable? And what happens to the individuals behind the statistics? Where does the \\\"human element\\\" go?\\n\\n\\\"We are always mining the universe for data in an attempt to locate the truth, and where we lack data, we fill in the gaps with interpretation. Even though all I had were names, genders, and birthdays, the children started to come alive for me, and I started to imagine them as individuals,\\\" said Stone. \\\"Take Jack Pinto\\u2014what a cool name! He must have liked that, and I imagined him to be good at sports. And then there is Chase Kowolsky, who was born on Halloween. And I wondered whether at his age he still thought that was cool, or was bummed out about having to share his birthday with a holiday.\\\"\\n\\nStone's installation, They Fill My Eyes, which was on display last January at the Mosaic Gallery in Pomona, consists of 20 paintings using colors derived from the Myosotis arvensis (Forget-Me-Not) and a geometric numbering system. Each piece is painted with Flashe on a 10\\\" x 10\\\" wood panel. The color on each indicates whether the child is a boy or girl (blue or pink). The number of colored segments reflects the child's age. The overall number of segments is placed in eight triangular sections from left to right, top to bottom, and show the child's birth date. The series title is a line taken from the old Marmalade song, \\\"Reflections of My Life.\\\"\\n\\nWhat began as a personal way for Stone to process the event has transformed into a poignant commentary on how we process grief, and how we can infuse raw data with a sense of humanity. And in the same way that the children came alive as individuals for Stone through her painting, she hopes that viewers of the art can experience the same. Patrons were provided with an informational pamphlet showing them how to read the panel.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't have any expectations about how people would respond, but I noticed people spending a lot of time with each panel, counting the numbers, deconstructing, and trying to make meaning the way I had,\\\" said Stone. \\\"This story was written in a language I understand and I felt compelled to translate it.\\\"\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Give Shape to a Dream\", \"source\": \"http://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/your-lasting-impact/give-shape-to-a-dream\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Information contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

In Germany, he met the missionaries and became a member of the church\\u2026.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGrowing up during socialism, my parents were not much into practicing traditional customs or superstitious activities. They just followed Russian culture \\u2026 and adopted western manners to a degree, as they were under state control about what they choose to do or study and how they live. And anybody who did not support the cultural shift campaign was persecuted back then. However, this does not mean that we don\\u2019t follow the local traditions and culture at all. My parents just gave up practicing some of the traditional rituals, such as offering the first cup of tea to nature or heaven, etc.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy parents had five children, and all seven of us lived in a small two-room apartment. It was a little difficult at the time because my father had lost his job, just like many others, but I think we overcame that challenging period as my parents worked hard. As we were the church members, we were able to overcome the hard time, I believe. It would have been difficult otherwise.\\n\\nThe place where we lived was notorious for its alcoholics wandering around and it was named as Valley of Drunkards. Even entering apartments, there would be drunk men on those stairs, or in dark corners and such was a common picture in the time. This environment did not affect the upbringing of me and my siblings as my parents did their best so that we can get a good education. When father joined the church, he thought of us, and he had a vision of helping the youth to avoid alcohol and other types of addictions. I think his choice has had a big impact on our family life\\u2026 I went to a lot of church activities, and played with many friends. From Primary class, I was busy spending time with brothers and sisters at home and at church. Initially, the missionaries taught us not only the principles of the gospel but also there were cultural exchanges. My classmates at school used to be surprised asking, \\u2018Why do foreigners come to your house?\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe advantage of living in Mongolia is you feel freedom. You can worship the religion you want and do what you love. I think I am lucky to be born in the country, because my freedom is protected by law. The disadvantages are economic poverty and financial crises, but freedom is more than material wealth. So, I am grateful for living in Mongolia.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 2: Uyanga Enkhtuvshin](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/11/uyanga-2-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 3: Uyanga Enkhtuvshin](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/11/uyanga-1-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 4: Uyanga Enkhtuvshin](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/11/uyanga-3-1.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Uyanga Enkhtuvshin - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/enkhtuvshin/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"PSYCHOLOGY\\n\\nTracking a Year of COVID-19 in Personal Diaries\\n\\nFor four decades, since 1981, Kathy Pezdek has been a professor of psychology at CGU\\u2014but in her own more precise definition of the kind of research she does (that indeed consumes her), she describes herself as a cognitive scientist, plain and simple.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I work, it is butt-in-the-chair-for-12-hours-a-day kind of work,\\u201d she says. \\u201cAs a cognitive scientist, my particular area of research is generally on the topic of memory.

In May, she collected their journals and was surprised at the sheer volume of responses. Some of them pointed to several confounding circumstances in a very turbulent year for multiple reasons.\\n\\nThis resulted in what Pezdek calls \\u201ca confound\\u201d\\u2014when two or more things happen simultaneously, and any of them could be the cause of the effect that is being examined.\\n\\n\\u201cFor example,\\u201d she explains, \\u201cone participant\\u2019s journal entry said: \\u2018I really do so much better if I don\\u2019t look at the news.

I know from many college students who I spend lots of time with that there were a lot of people that were overwhelmed by their negative emotions and did not cope very well. They sank into depression and didn\\u2019t get much done.\\u201d\\n\\nFor Pezdek, being isolated at home in front of a computer should have offered a silver lining to them.\\n\\n\\u201cI kept saying you\\u2019ll never have a better opportunity to get work done. You don\\u2019t ever have to leave your computer,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nCoping as We Get Older\\n----------------------\\n\\nAccording to Pezdek, the project also suggested that older people have a more realistic context for everything that happens in their life. In many cases, they\\u2019ve learned and developed better coping strategies. That said, when her project participants finally received their vaccinations, it was like they were \\u201cborn again.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey got their lives back.

Instead, she would remind people that when they\\u2019re coping with an unknown situation\\u2014the duration of which is unknown to them\\u2014they should anticipate that it could lead to a long-term change in their lives and well-being.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t just collapse in lethargy, withdraw, and get depressed,\\u201d she says. Instead, it\\u2019s more important to adapt daily strategies to cope with it.\\n\\nOscar Wilde once said that memory is the diary we all carry with us.

Working with colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, we have a identified an opportunity and need to apply new and emerging mobile, web-based, map-based, and cost-effective technologies to address this information handoff challenge. The CrashHelp System is a web-based information system aimed at helping EMS field personnel (i.e., EMTs, paramedics) to more efficiently capture essential incident and patient information and to securely transmit that data to emergency room/trauma center practitioners.\\n\\n1.  Paramedics/EMT\\u2019s use a smartphone to securely capture pictures, digital audio recordings, video, and the most basic patient and incident information.\\n2.  The information collected on scene is sent securely to emergency room/trauma center facilities to a secure web-based interface for practitioners to view on demand.\\n\\nThis is accomplished using three main components as follows:\\n\\n1.  A mobile application that resides on a handheld device (currently an Android smartphone) that is used by EMTs/paramedics in the field.\\n2.

I do not say this blithely \\u2014 there is work to be done in terms of intellectual and existential reconciliation between these various ways of knowing. But Mormonism, at least as I understand and experience it, is a capacious, generous religion. It is predicated upon the notion of a universe full of intelligence(s). The basic premise is one of diversity and progression toward greater light and truth. So I\\u2019m with Brigham Young and all the others that say that Mormonism embraces all truth, regardless of where we find it. If it comes from people named Darwin, Marx, or Friedan, that\\u2019s just fine \\u2014 they\\u2019re children of God too.  \\nTo be sure, along the way I\\u2019ve had to make some adjustments. My faith is not the same it was 20 years ago. Then again, I don\\u2019t think anybody\\u2019s faith should be the same as it was 20 years ago. Our faith should grow and mature and breathe and incorporate all our life experiences right along with us.  \\nOne problem we sometimes face in contemporary Mormonism (and this is true of other religions too) is that we sometimes juvenilize our religion. By that I mean that we develop a certain kind of spirituality and religious discourse that generally works for teenagers, and then we flash-freeze that as if it is the ideal form of religion. We don\\u2019t do that with other realms of human knowledge \\u2014 we fully expect that our high school students will go on to college and learn more about the world, complicating the binaries and more simplistic or basic things they had learned earlier as part of age-appropriate education. 10th grade biology doesn\\u2019t fully explain the natural world. So why do we expect that 10th grade Seminary should fully explain the spiritual world? Both as individuals and as a church we have to develop the capacity to let our faith mature with us, meaning that it takes into greater account the complexities of life and the cosmos. Life generally gets messier as we age. Our religion should be able to handle that.  \\nSometimes I see people whose graduate school-level secular knowledge comes into conflict with their high school-level spiritual knowledge. When that happens, religion stands no chance. The kind of discourse we foster during the 3 hour block, which is suited for a general membership and appropriately tailored to \\u201cthe least of these,\\u201d does not represent the sum total or depth capacities of Mormonism.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Patrick Mason on Reddit - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/patrick-mason-on-reddit/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"I\\u2019m a believer in a both-and approach. Meaning this: In our wards, much like our families, we do not choose our community (except to the extent that we choose where we live, which often correlates with socioeconomic opportunity and privilege). The geographically based ward, especially in areas where wards are larger and encompass a diversity of neighborhoods and thus people, is one of the geniuses of Mormonism. It is a brilliant sociological vehicle for discipleship. I\\u2019m very much a Eugene England \\u201cWhy the Church is as True as the Gospel\\u201d guy here. We are forced to associate with people we wouldn\\u2019t normally choose to, and that is (if we allow it to be) redemptive.  \\nBut it can also be frustrating. So that\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s also important for us to find communities of voluntary affinity \\u2014 in other words, some group that you join to find community with people who are more or less like you in some way. Some people find this at work, others in their neighborhood, others in a bowling league, others online. Whatever it is, it\\u2019s important to find people that you can talk to about the things that really matter to you, in a voice that\\u2019s authentic. That can\\u2019t always be done at church on Sunday, because that\\u2019s not necessarily the point of church on Sunday.  \\nSo my view is that internet community can be a great supplement to flesh-and-blood community, though if had to choose between the two I would always opt for the latter. Fortunately we generally don\\u2019t have to make an either-or choice!\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nShare\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Patrick Mason on Reddit - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/patrick-mason-on-reddit/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: 2000 Benin Artifacts](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/beninbronze2_1.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/beninbronze2_1.jpg)  \\n_2000 Benin Artifacts_\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** NA  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Benin  \\n**Provenience Location:** 1897-BeninState,Nigeria  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:** 1897\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Spoils of war\\n\\n**Nation:**\\n\\n**Location:** Various\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nLooted Benin Artifacts - NA\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) not relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2000  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:**  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Inquiry/Demand\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Prince Akenzua  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Nigeria  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** In Transition  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Institution\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** British House of Commons  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United Kingdom  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2,000 Benin Artifacts \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/2000-benin-artifacts/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Admissions\\n----------\\n\\nPrograms & Student Life\\n-----------------------\\n\\nCareer\\n------\\n\\n![Image 1: Ro Lee profile image](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CGU-FlameSupergraph1024x1024-Right-600x600.jpg)\\n\\n#### Ro Lee\\n\\nAssociate Director, Career & Professional Development\\n\\n##### Email\\n\\n[ro.lee@cgu.edu](mailto:ro.lee@cgu.edu)\\n\\nRequest more information about the Drucker School of Management\\n\\nAdmissions Representatives\\n\\n*   #### [**Adriana Leake**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/adriana-leake/)\\n    \\n    Assistant Director of Admissions\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-3310\\n    \\n    E: [adriana.leake@cgu.edu](mailto:adriana.leake@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Management, MS in Finance, PhD in Management\\n    \\n*   #### [**Michael Mirabella**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/michael-mirabella/)\\n    \\n    Director of Recruitment for the Drucker School of Management\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-9049\\n    \\n    E: [michael.mirabella@cgu.edu](mailto:michael.mirabella@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Arts Management, MA in Management, MA in Leadership, MS in Finance, PhD in Executive Management, PhD in Management, SOAR\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Staff - Drucker School of Management - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/school/center-for-information-systems-and-technology/about/staff/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### With a focus on interdisciplinarity and hands-on learning, the Master of Arts in Applied Gender Studies (AGS) gives you the opportunity to use knowledge in gender issues as a vital force for change in today\\u2019s world.\\n\\nSituated at the intersection of gender, culture, and history, CGU\\u2019s MA in Applied Gender Studies explores today\\u2019s pertinent women\\u2019s and gender issues through creative, hands-on practice in order to advance modern society.

She seeks to integrate diverse perspectives and technologies into the classroom and has taught in-person, asynchronous, and synchronous online courses. Reichard has successfully shepherded 11 PhD students through the OB doctorate and co-authored 25 publications with 20 different student co-authors.\\n\\nAs a leader in her field, Reichard founded and developed LeAD Labs in 2013. Along with a small group of graduate students, the goal of LeAD Labs is to advance and align the research and practice of leader development. As of 2021, she has been awarded $818,307 in grants and contracts across 15 sources of funding employing 78 graduate students in consulting projects. These graduate students worked as assessors, facilitators, actors, coaches, evaluators, data managers, project managers, and research consultants.

Differences emerge not only about the _is_ of humankind and what humans are and do in fact, but also about the _ought_ of a humane humanity and how one should live as a human being.\\n\\nAnswers to the questions about our humanity and _humanitas_ (Cicero) have been sought along five routes: by contrasting the human with the non-human (other animals), the more than human (the divine), the inhuman (negative human behaviors), the superhuman (what humans will become), or the transhuman (thinking machines). In each case the question at stake and the point of comparison is a different one: a relative difference within a shared animality, an absolute difference from the divine, a practical difference with respect to the ideal of a good human life, an evolutionary differ\\u00adence between the present and future states of humankind, and a difference in kind between human bio\\u00adlogical evolution and technological enhancement. In all those respects the idea of humanity has been defined differently. What makes humans human? What does it mean for humans to live a human life? What is the _humanitas_ for which we ought to strive?\\n\\nWe convene the 40th Annual Claremont Philosophy of Religion Conference on \\u201cHumanity: An Endangered Idea\\u201d to discuss these questions in the light of a fourfold challenge:\\n\\n(1)\\u00a0 The first is the _biological challenge_ to human **distinctiveness**. Biological and neurophysiological re\\u00adsearch increasingly level out and dissolve clear-cut distinctions between humans and other ani\\u00admals and living species: reason, rationality, deliberation, decision-making, free choice, and inten\\u00adtional action all come by degrees and can be found in one way or another in other animals as well. Humans are part of nature and must be understood as embedded in complex ecosyst\\u00adems. Therefore, the view that humans are special and stand out from the animal world in a significant way is challenged, and human **speciesism** is banned.\\n\\n(2)\\u00a0 The second is the _technological challenge_ that seeks to overcome the limitations of our biological nature by technical means. The truth about us is to be sought not in our evolutionary past but in our technological future. The romanticism of ecological bioconservatives is countered with the techno\\u00adlogical optimism of a progressive perfectionism, transhumanism, **extropianism** or **post\\u00adgenderism**. Compared to smart machines, it is not our intellect but our biology that makes us special. However, if research into biological computing and nanotechnology keeps progressing at the present rate, then the difference between humans and machines will soon be negligible and there will be no space to define humanity. The challenge to the idea of humanity from this side is that humanity as we know it will disappear when superintelligent thinking machines will have superseded humans and human intellect.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2019 Humanity: An Endangered Idea? \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/2019-humanity-an-endangered-idea/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"(3)\\u00a0 The third challenge is the _anthropological challenge._ If we try to delineate what is human about humans not by comparing humans to other animals but to other humans, then it is striking to see that regularities of a common biology and evolutionary past are by far outdone by the cul\\u00adtural differences and plurality in which humans adapt to different situations and circum\\u00adstances. Human life knows choice between options and the freedom to choose, not only the causality of nature and the convent\\u00adional necessities of culture. The anthropological challenge to the idea of humanity is that humanity is a normative project, not merely a biological fact, and that there is an endemic normative conflict about how this project has been or should be worked out in human culture and history.\\n\\n(4)\\u00a0 The fourth challenge is the _theological challenge_ of arriving at a view of human nature by com\\u00adparing humans to the divine. This challenge is underestimated if one conceives the divine merely as a cultural construction and not as a self-disclosing reality. The point of this challenge, at least in the monotheistic traditions, is to outline a vision of a good human life that has its center in safeguarding the distinction between creature and creator. It is a normative idea of humanity that envisages human life at its best to be a life in harmony with the gifts of the creator (the gift of life and the gift of love) and open to the needs of God\\u2019s neighbors (as expressed in the double commandment of love) and of all other creatures who are the addressees and recipients of God\\u2019s gifts.\\n\\nThese are the challenges that a contemporary understanding of the idea of humanity must ad\\u00address. To do so is the objective of the 40th Annual Philosophy of Religion Conference at Claremont, California, on February 21-23, 2019.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2019 Humanity: An Endangered Idea? \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/2019-humanity-an-endangered-idea/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Group of women](https://research.cgu.edu/wincart/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2018/05/cover-photo.jpg)Hafa Adai! Chamorros are those with ancestry to the indigenous people of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). According to the 2000 census there were 58,240 Guamanian/Chamorros living in the United States. California has the largest population of Guamanians/Chamorros (33,849) outside of Guam and the CNMI, and Southern California is home to 17,885 Guamanians/Chamorros, and represents extremely underserved populations with regards to health and cancer care services ([http://factfinder2.census.gov/](http://factfinder2.census.gov/), 2000). The Chamorro people are a very close knit community both on the island and on the mainland. Catholicism is the leading religion among Chamorros, and in California, Eucharist ministers play an active role in community health issues. Ten per cent of Chamorro families in California are below the poverty line, and 20% have less than a high school degree (Tanjasiri, et al. 2008).\\n\\nThe breast is the most common site for cancer among Chamorro women. One study showed that in a given year, only 25% of Chamorro women had a mammogram, and only 27% performed monthly breast self-examinations (BSE), both important practices for early detection (Tanjasiri & Sablan-Santos, 2001). Very little literature may be found on the cancer risks of Chamorro males. However, a 2004 study assessed the colorectal risk factors of 100 Chamorro men in the United States. Although the results indicated that the study sample reported a high rate of health promotion through lifestyle (74.4% were current in their colorectal cancer screenings), the nationwide averages were much lower (Wu, et al., 2004). For Chamorros still living on the CNMI, cancer is the \\u201csecond leading cause of death\\u201d (Tseng et al., 2004).\\n\\nThe Guam Communications Network (GCN) was established in 1993, as a nonprofit 501(c) (3) corporation. It is the sole community-based multi-service agency serving Chamorros in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and has been a recipient of numerous government and private foundation funding. GCN has a history of fiscal and program management (with an annual budget of nearly $250,000), and operates over twelve different cultural enrichment and social service programs that are designed to encompass cultural promotion and preservation, health and welfare, breast cancer research, senior care management, tobacco education and prevention services, HIV/AIDS education, youth leadership and advocacy development, senior health and welfare, tobacco usage cessation, and free and low cost insurance enrollment application services. GCN employs six Chamorro men and women and has seven volunteers/consultants working as community health workers and lay health workers for these various projects. In addition, GCN has over six years experience in community participatory research collaborative. A recently completed program, \\u201cA Network Based Intervention for Chamorros in Southern California,\\u201d is a three year community participatory collaborative project, with Sora Park Tanjasiri and California State University, Fullerton, focusing on improving cancer screening rates among Chamorro women in Southern California. Finally GCN has catalyzed the development of several Chamorro groups, including a I Lalahi (Chamorro Men\\u2019s Collaborative) and I\\u2019Famalao\\u2019an (a Chamorro women\\u2019s group).\\n\\nContact: Lola Sablan-Santos, Executive Director  \\nGuam Communications Network, Inc.  \\n333 H Street, Suite 5000  \\nChula Vista, CA 91910\\n\\nTel: (619) 551-7068  \\nFax: (619) 551-7001  \\nEmail: [lolasgcn@gmail.com](mailto:lolasgcn@gmail.com)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Chamorro \\u2014 Weaving an Islander Network for Cancer Awareness, Research, and Training\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/wincart/communities/chamorro/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"*   U.S. Census Bureau, \\u201cAmerican FactFinder\\u201d, <[http://factfinder2.census.gov/](http://factfinder2.census.gov/)[](http://factfinder.census.gov/)\\\\>; retrieved June 16, 2010.\\n*   Tanjasiri, S.

Hilton is an adjunct professor in the School of Educational Studies and the Center for Information Systems & Technology at Claremont Graduate University. Additionally, she serves as the director of educational services for the Claremont Unified School District. She has extensive K-12 experience, teaching all levels of mathematics and science (biology, chemistry, and physics) as well as site and district administration. She holds valid teaching (science and math) and administrative credentials in New Jersey and California as well as National Board Certification in adolescent/young adult science \\u2013 physics, having completed the renewal process in 2013.\\n\\nHilton earned both her BA in secondary education and MA in science & math education from the University of Rhode Island and her PhD in Education from Claremont Graduate University. Her postsecondary experience includes teaching mathematics to undergraduate students at Stockton University in New Jersey and later at the University of California, Riverside. She also taught science education methods classes to teacher candidates at the University of La Verne. She has taught quantitative methods classes to master and doctoral students at CGU in both the School of Educational Studies as well as the Center for Information Systems & Technology. She also co-taught a transdisciplinary course at CGU with three other professors (two at CGU and one at San Jose State University) titled \\u201cReasoning for the Social Sciences: Transdisciplinary Perspectives.\\u201d The goal of this course was to introduce students to the techniques of transdisciplinary reasoning for the social sciences. Students utilized various analytical tools to examine local, national, and global issues. Hilton has served on numerous dissertation committees as either a chair or member. This experience allows her the opportunity to work closely with students who are conducting and presenting research results on the most current and innovative educational issues and topics.\\n\\nHilton\\u2019s professional interests center on areas that affect student achievement in the STEM fields, specifically equity issues in science and mathematics, as well as teacher preparation. She recently completed work on two research projects at CGU. The first was the Claremont Colleges STEM Initiative (CCSI) Project funded by the National Science Foundation aimed at improving STEM education by increasing the number and quality of STEM teachers through innovative teacher preparation, professional development, and research into STEM teaching and learning. CCSI was a collaborative effort between education faculty from Claremont Graduate University and STEM faculty from the Claremont Colleges. Her role in this project was to assist in the calibration of the observation tools to determine best practices in STEM teaching. The second project involved the identification and observation of highly effective teachers of vulnerable student populations (e.g., English learners and underrepresented groups) to identify instructional practices that promote student learning.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n\\nCo-authored with Christopher Njunge, et al. \\u201cHome Field Advantage in Major League Soccer\\u201d.

Digital twins can help users simulate real situations and their outcomes, ultimately improving design and decision-making. We have been using \\u2018digital twins\\u2019 for simulation experiments (see [\\u201cSimulation: From Impossible to Probable\\u201d](https://research.cgu.edu/drucker-customer-lab/simulation-it-always-seems-impossible-until-its-done/)) to test if new technology is improving performance of a system.

She is a developmental psychologist interested in understanding and supporting the positive development and moral growth of young people. Most recently, she has investigated these topics through the lens of young people\\u2019s purposes in life.\\n\\nWork in her [Adolescent Moral Development lab](https://www.kendallcottonbronk.com/) has focused on addressing two primary questions around purpose. First, what does purpose look like among diverse groups of young people, including youth growing up in poorly resourced communities, youth growing up in developing countries, and youth growing up amidst global economic challenges? Second, work in her lab has focused on creating and testing strategies for fostering purpose among youth. Resulting purpose-fostering tools have been shared with thousands of youth across the country.\\n\\nCurrent research in the lab is focused on family purpose, purpose among adolescent and young adult cancer survivors, and purpose among street children in Liberia. Her work has been funded by the Spencer Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, and the Fulbright Foundation.\\n\\nIn addition to her substantive interests, Bronk has also helped define and outline the parameters of the exemplar methodology, an approach to empirical research that provides insight into exemplary, or highly developed, forms of growth. Understanding not only what is common but also what is possible is critical to a complete understanding of human development and flourishing. Bronk teaches master\\u2019s and doctoral classes on positive contexts, child development, adolescent development, and qualitative research methods. She also teaches a directed research course for first-year positive developmental doctoral students.\\n\\nAfter graduating with a BS from Northwestern University, Bronk earned her doctorate from Stanford University and completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at the Stanford Center on Adolescence.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nCo-authored with Reichard, R.

In providing a comparison of how Mormonism and Shambhala Buddhism fits within their respective \\u201cwestern\\u201d and \\u201ceastern\\u201d traditions, I will focus on how each provides a type of \\u201crestoration\\u201d of Christ\\u2019s and the Buddha\\u2019s original and most sacred teachings. Implicit in this comparison is the role that Joseph Smith and Ch\\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche played as prophet, seer, revelator, and tert\\u00f6n (treasure discoverer) in restoring the authoritative power and teachings in their respective traditions. Through my comparative analysis I attempt to bring forward aspects of both lineages that emphasize the need to move toward a more inclusive and ecumenical approach to the study of religion. I argue that efforts in exploring religious pluralism in such a manner will lead not only to greater understanding from the standpoint of each tradition, but it may also encourage greater opportunities for inter-religious dialogue.\\n\\n**Jacob Baker**\\u00a0\\u2013 \\u201cGod With Us\\u201d: Panentheism, Pansyntheism, and the Mormon Concept of God\\n\\n> \\u201cThough originally developed over two centuries ago in Western thought, the concept of panentheism has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional theism and pantheism. It seeks to avoid both isolating God from the world (the absolute transcendence of traditional theism) and identifying God with the world (the absolute immanence of pantheism), by seeking a middle position that asserts that the Being of God penetrates the whole universe, so that every part of it exists in him, but that His Being is yet more than the universe. Proponents of a panentheistic view of God argue that panentheism fulfills theology\\u2019s central task of articulating the appropriate harmony between immanence and transcendence, as well as a satisfactory reconciliation with contemporary science. To date there has been no extended treatment of a comparison between the Mormon concept of God and panentheism. Such an exercise in comparative religion would serve to help insert the Mormon concept of God into contemporary scholarly discourse. This paper seeks to lay a groundwork for such a comparison. There are interesting parallels and dissimilarities between the two concepts, but I will ultimately argue that the Mormon concept of God does not fit comfortably into theistic, pantheistic, or even panentheistic categories. Instead, the Mormon concept of God might more accurately be described as \\u201cpansyntheistic,\\u201d a term coined by theologian Ruth Page and closely related to panentheism.\\u201d\\n\\n**Brian Birch**\\u00a0\\u2013 \\u201cTreasure them Up\\u201d: Providence, Pluralism, and the Plan of Salvation\\n\\n> As the LDS Church moves into a more inclusive phase of its development, questions of religious diversity will become increasingly relevant. A well-known maxim among Latter-day Saints is Joseph Smith\\u2019s declaration that \\u201cwe should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true \\u2018Mormons.'\\u201d One important means of gathering and treasuring these principles is the effort to make theological sense of them. Questions thus emerge: What are possible candidates for these \\u201cprinciples\\u201d? Can Mormons declare as true a Hindu, Muslim, or Catholic principle? How tradition-specific can religious concepts be in order for it to possess this kind of truth-value? What concept of truth is required for this kind of inclusivism? This paper will explore these questions and examine some theological implications of a Mormon theology of religions.\\n\\n**Richard Bushman**\\u00a0\\u2013 On Being Ill at Ease in the World\\n\\n> Mormonism, like every other American cultural system, is nestled in the midst of the great cultural systems dominating our time: science, democracy, and capitalism. With none of these is it perfectly at ease. Despite the efforts of individual Mormons to demonstrate compatibility with each one of these systems, Mormonism chides and chafes each one of them. Efforts to achieve perfect harmony not only lead to the idolatries of our era, they dilute Mormonism. Implicit in our belief is a potent critique of culture which it would be a mistake to dissipate in our eagerness to fit in. Our task is to make the most of the creative tensions with the ambient culture and to enjoy being ill at ease.\\n\\n**James Faulconer**\\u00a0\\u2013 The Secular and the Sacred\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2009 SMPT Conference: Upon All Nations - Religious Pluralism - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/2009-smpt-conference-upon-all-nations-religious-pluralism/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**James Faulconer**\\u00a0\\u2013 The Secular and the Sacred\\n\\n> Secularity is a necessary condition of contemporary democracy. One need know little history to know the horrors that a nonsecular government can wreak. Nevertheless, we are short-changed if secularism is not augmented by \\u201cprophets\\u201d in a broad sense, by the ethical intuitions of thosethrough whom at least the sacred and perhaps also the holy are revealed. Secularism seems to have no need of prophets. It cannot understand them because they stand outside the horizon of its possibilities. Yet it is precisely that position outside that makes the prophets valuable to secular society. Being outside, the prophets can bring the sacred into secularism, raising the question of justice and giving secularity a ground from which to make just decisions.\\n\\n**Alonzo Gaskill**\\u00a0\\u2013 Mormonism, Hagiography, and the Virgin Mary: A Look at the Role of Patron Saints in LDS Belief and Practice\\n\\n> Throughout the church\\u2019s history, Latter-day Saint leaders have occasionally publically expressed their discomfort with the place of patron saints in Roman Catholic worship and practice. It seems fair to say that such criticisms are, more often than not, the result of misunderstandings as to what the official teaching of the Roman Catholic church is on saints, their role and powers. This paper will seek to do two things: (1) establish what the official position of the Catholic church is on patron saints, and (2) show that Mormonism has their own patron saints that function in ways very similar to Catholic saints.\\n\\n**Deidre Green**\\u00a0\\u2013 Mormonism, Gender, and Sin-Talk\\n\\n> Mormonism relies on a rigid and essentialist bifurcation of gender to support its patriarchal structure and doctrine of theosis. This essentialism is particularly relevant with regard to sin-talk. Latter-day Saints often hear that because women are innately less prone to sin, they are in less need of priesthood responsibility than men and better suited to the nurture and moral upbringing of children. Such sin-talk reinforces harmful gender essentialism. This essentialism leads to patronizing discourse about the moral superiority of women, which is only ostensibly positive since it bears important implications for what it means to be a female self. For example, in LDS soteriology women cannot be \\u201csons of perdition,\\u201d which means that men are capable of a degree of damnation that women are not. Such beliefs do not elevate women, but rather reflect essential gender differences in knowledge and agency. Ultimately, gendered sin-talk renders women less than agents and less than persons. As Stephen Ray argues in his book, Do No Harm: Social Sin and Christian Responsibility, essentialist discourses about sin lends itself to creating a hierarchy of sin, which works to focus attention on personal purity and piety rather than on issues of social justice.\\n\\n**Farooq Hassan**\\u00a0\\u2013 Pluralistic practices in the life of prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\\n\\n> The concept of pluralism and its dimensions promoted in Islam has been attested to by comments from the international community in various publications and fora. Islam is being labeled as the \\u201cenemy of the civilization,\\u201d but the fact is that pluralism was a reality that Islam addressed at its very beginning 1400 years ago. Islam approves of tolerance among individuals, groups, states and family members. The teaching of the Quran and the transparent life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) prove the pluralistic approach and utmost tolerance in Islam at all levels in life with all human beings. Muhammad (PBUH) preached and practiced tolerance and acceptance towards non-Muslims in every walk of life. Islam can be properly understood by nonMuslims if projected theoretically as well as practically in the right spirit by Muslims in general and scholars in particular. Muslims and people of all other religions face common challenges and dilemmas which have to be understood. All of us have to share the planet Earth; no matter what religion we belong to. So why should we not do it gracefully\\u2014in the true, pluralistic way?\\n\\n**Blair Hodges**\\u00a0\\u2013 C. S.

Lewis responded to lifelong friend Arthur Greeves. \\u201cI believe in no religion. . . Superstition of course in every age has held the common people, but in every age the educated and thinking ones have stood outside it.\\u201d Almost fifteen years later he confessed to Arthur, \\u201cHow deep I am just now beginning to see: for I have just passed on from believing in God to definitely believing in Christ\\u2014in Christianity.\\u201d Since the 1950s various Latter-day Saints have shown particular interest in Lewis\\u2019s religious and fictional works. This paper will make use of Lewis\\u2019s recently published collected letters to argue that Lewis\\u2019s transition from atheism to Christianity led him to view conversion in general as a process of \\u201ccoming home\\u201d to God by retaining good and rejecting evil. For Lewis and Latter-day Saints alike, various beliefs can be seen as stepping stones or signposts pointing to higher truths on the road home. Part of Lewis\\u2019s wide appeal results from an ecumenical view of other religions that is similar to (though looser than) that of Latter-day Saints. Lewis sought for ways to hope for those not converted to Christianity during mortality\\u2014those whom he referred to as \\u201cvirtuous unbelievers.\\u201d Because Lewis never came close to joining the LDS Church, he raises interesting questions on the eternal status of non-LDS inspired voices; to Latter-day Saints, Lewis is the virtuous unbeliever. Often quoted by LDS General Authorities, teachers and authors, Lewis is representative of God\\u201ds inspiration which Latter-day Saints believe can (and does) exist apart from official LDS channels.\\n\\n**Jennifer Lane**\\u00a0\\u2013 I Am among You As One that Serveth\\n\\n> The status of women in LDS doctrine and practice is currently vigorously debated. This paper briefly highlights points of doctrinal distinctiveness in relation to traditional Christianity, but argues that to emphasize these doctrines above the life and imitation of Christ is a profound misunderstanding of Church doctrine and the message of Christianity. Efforts to emphasize the divine identity and role of women are important, but must also be seen in light the radical demands of the imitation of Christ and the model of servanthood that he offers. This discipleship of service is, however, a path that each must freely embrace.\\n\\n**Richard Livingston**\\u00a0\\u2013 The Paradox & Possibility of LDS Theological Discourse\\n\\n> Without a doubt one of the most fascinating, peculiar, and even ironic aspects of Latter-day Saint discourse is its extremely ambiguous relationship with theology. On the one hand, it has a rich and complex heritage of theological reflection. On the other, in recent decades there has been a rather influential impulse that has taken a decidedly negative stance toward any formal engagement with \\u201cGod-talk,\\u201d rejecting the very possibility in an LDS context. In my brief presentation, I want (1) clarify the basic task of theology-i.e., elucidate what it means to do theology at all; (2) highlight what I take to be the most salient concerns held by those who argue against the value of and need for sustained theological exploration; (3) show why I think such aversions are largely misguided and mistaken-misguided because they are typically based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what theology has been and can be; and mistaken, because so many arguments against theology ultimately fall into a sort of pragmatic self-contradiction; and (4) suggest several methodological alternatives that I view as both appropriate and compelling within the parameters of LDS self-understandings-i.e., propose a few \\u201clive\\u201d options. In short, I intend to draw out the paradoxical polarities that characterize the contemporary landscape of Mormon discourse on the Divine, and argue in favor of not only the possibility and viability of LDS theology as such, but also the necessity and vitality of an engagement with and development of multiple LDS theo-logoi.\\n\\n**Jared Ludlow**\\u00a0\\u2013 Uniting All Peoples by the Gospel\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2009 SMPT Conference: Upon All Nations - Religious Pluralism - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/2009-smpt-conference-upon-all-nations-religious-pluralism/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Jared Ludlow**\\u00a0\\u2013 Uniting All Peoples by the Gospel\\n\\n> As an apostle, David O. McKay undertook a world mission tour in 1921. One of his stops was Laie, Hawaii, where he \\u201cwitnessed a most impressive and inspiring sight\\u201d as 127 children from many nationalities participated in a U.S. flag raising ceremony. When President McKay later recalled the flag raising ceremony of 1921, he referred to it as a \\u201cmelting pot.\\u201d This paper explores McKay\\u2019s vision of bringing together diverse ethnicities and backgrounds\\u2014taught in American principles (and even language), but especially unified under the gospel of Jesus Christ\\u2014and compares it with the concept of the \\u201cmelting pot\\u201d which originated in an early 1900s Broadway play. In this play, actors in various ethnic costumes descended into a \\u201cmelting pot\\u201d and then reemerged from the other side dressed as \\u201cAmericans.\\u201d Was this the international experience President McKay envisioned when using the term \\u201cmelting pot\\u201d?\\n\\n**Paul Miller**\\u00a0\\u2013 Subjectivity and the Sovereignty of God: Engaging with Karl Barth on Revelation Theology\\n\\n> While a propositional model of revelation is vital in developing doctrine and legitimizing priesthood authority, my paper focuses on the comparable need for an experiential model that clarifies how ordinary people receive and interpret divine revelation. As a theological ethicist, I am interested in the role of prudential judgment in discerning God\\u2019s will for the present moment. In taking the reality of continuing revelation seriously, Latter-day Saints are well aware of the problems associated with spiritual discernment. Mormon leaders appeal to various principles to assist members in understanding the revelatory process, such as the claim that revelation applies to each person\\u2019s stewardship and that God honors human agency. My paper seeks to clarify and evaluate these criteria by exploring the revelation theology of Karl Barth. I highlight his warnings against anthropocentrism, his central concern with acknowledging the freedom and sovereignty of God, and his views on the role of inspiration in transmitting canonized doctrine to succeeding generations.\\n\\n**Jason Monson**\\u00a0\\u2013 Mormonism and the Religious Other\\n\\n> There are numerous reasons for Latter-day Saints to be interested in the \\u2018religious other\\u2019 and a variety of positions one can take in approaching them. These various positions are fully addressed in Schmidt-Leukel\\u2019s theological typology which considers all logical possibilities of theological approaches to other faith traditions within the categories of exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism. The diversity of views in Latter-day Saint scriptures, and particularly in the words of LDS Church leaders, allow them to be used to justify each of these theological positions by placing emphasis on particular passages at the expense of others. Although the inclusivist position appears to be the most common in LDS teachings and the most widely accepted, exclusivist notions are still evident and the possibility remains for a form of \\u2018Mormon Pluralism.\\u2019\\n\\n**Mark Olsen**\\u00a0\\u2013 On the Corruptibility of Matter: The Possibilities for a Material Version of an Immortal Soul\\n\\n> Jan Erik Jones argues that Mormon materialism, together with certain assumptions about the corruptibility of matter, require the belief that the functional elements (or Lockean \\u201cnodes\\u201d) of the soul are constantly transferred by God to other actual material constituents in the face of traumatic physical events. I argue in this paper that such a view of constant transfer of functional elements is not necessary, and that furthermore, it defies Mormon orthodoxy in insisting that matter is inherently corruptible. In the process of resolving, however, the problems raised by Jones\\u2019s argument, I propose a view of matter that allows that some middle sized objects may be affected by radically traumatic physical events without dissolution.\\n\\n**Randall Paul**\\u00a0\\u2013 Sociality: Pluralism in the Experience and Thought of Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n> While Joseph Smith did not directly address the topic of religious pluralism in a systematic theory, he seemed to decry it in the First Vision but embrace it in Nauvoo when he made practical appeals for reciprocal religious acceptance. I will discuss how he negotiated this tension with his radical belief that the love of God could not be coerced and really be love\\u2014nor could God win a believing heart by any power other than persuasion. Religious freedom (which means religious pluralism) was a theological tenet of his religion based in the sociality of a God who desires loving unity and real difference. After detailing the theological structure of Mormon pluralism, the sociality of gods, I conclude by discussing how some of Joseph Smith\\u2019s statements pertaining to religious pluralism and conflict might be useful for advocates of any tradition.\\n\\n**Chris Smith**\\u00a0\\u2013 Sibling Rivalry: Mormonism and Pentecostals\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2009 SMPT Conference: Upon All Nations - Religious Pluralism - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/2009-smpt-conference-upon-all-nations-religious-pluralism/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Chris Smith**\\u00a0\\u2013 Sibling Rivalry: Mormonism and Pentecostals\\n\\n> Pentecostals and Mormons have more unfavorable views of each other than of other Christian groups. To a large degree, this animosity stems from their similarities rather than from their differences. The two groups sects share a common ancestry, similar maps of the universe, similar theologies and experiences, and similar missionary ambitions. Despite modest strides toward reconciliation in the United States, it is likely that mutual demonization will continue for the foreseeable future, especially as the two faiths compete for converts in the global south. Both groups must overcome significant theological and cultural obstacles to dialogue if they are to leave sibling rivalry behind in the spirit of Christian brotherhood.\\n\\n**Joseph Spencer**\\u00a0\\u2013 Omnipotent Weakness: Toward a Mormon Doctrine of God\\u2019s Omnipotence\\n\\n> John D. Caputo has, in The Weakness of God: A Theology of the Event, argued that the traditional distinction between God as ontologically existent and God as ontologically non-existent should be deconstructed, making way for a third possibility\\u2014one might worship God as ontologically deferred. In the end, however, such a move can be revealed to be an essential politicization of God: the ontologically deferred God is the evental God of politics. Alain Badiou and Jean-Luc Marion provide a possible framework for making sense of what is ultimately at stake in Caputo\\u2019s politicization of God, opening the possibility of there being a fourth category for God\\u2019s essence. If orthodoxy regards God as ontologically strong (omnipotent), the critical tradition regards God as aesthetically weak (impotent), and the Derridean movement regards God as politically weak (potently impotent), Mormonism might be said to regard God as amorously weak, such that omnipotence is redefined as all-loving-ness. This, in the end, cannot be separated, however, from the Mormon idea that God is a gendered person.\\n\\n**Sheila Taylor**\\u00a0\\u2013 Doctrinal Development and Continuing Revelation\\n\\n> In the nineteenth century, John Henry Newman proposed a model of doctrinal development as a way of understanding revelation in the church. In this process of development, one does not add new truths to the deposit of revelation, but continues over time to unpack and better articulate the truths contained therein. This kind of approach can also be seen in the work of twentieth-century Catholic theologian Karl Rahner, who distinguishes between original transcendental revelation and its categorical articulation. In this paper, I will look at these ideas in relation to the LDS notion of continuing revelation, and argue that the differences between contemporary LDS and Catholic approaches at least partially arise from different understandings of what revelation is. I will also consider the question of how much the models actually differ when it comes to practical application.\\n\\n**Roy Whitaker**\\u00a0\\u2013 Is the Mormon Church Still Racist?: Methodological Approaches to the Current Challenge of Blacks in Mormonism\\n\\n> Despite it having been thirty years since the Mormon Church rescinded the priesthood ban of members of African ancestry, the controversy still remains whether Mormonism is still racist. That is, just because a particular practice ended, it does not mean the ideology behind it has too. This paper explores methodological approaches to this 21st century challenge facing this new religious movement. To be sure, the historic debate on this problem is not monolithic, yet two recent voices push the debate forward: Eugene England and Dwight Hopkins in their essays in Mormonism in Dialogue with Contemporary Christian Theologies. This paper particularly highlights England\\u2019s approach to the problem of whether racism still exists in the Mormon Church today.\\n\\n**Miranda Wilcox**\\u00a0\\u2013 Teaching Religious Pluralism and Brigham Young University\\n\\n> As violence perpetuated in the name of religious ideology escalates around the world, experts of comparative religions advocate that one of the most crucial, though neglected, ethical responsibilities of a contemporary world citizen is to develop religious literacy, literacy that promotes respectful communication rather than confrontation among people of faith. These experts suggest that religious literacy ought to be a component of every college and university curriculum. Such a goal seems particularly feasible at institutions, such as Brigham Young University, where religious education is already a fundamental aspect of the curriculum. However, BYU\\u2019s comprehensive focus on the Mormon tradition discourages students from encountering and engaging with alternate religious perspectives and developing a deeper understanding of their own tradition by engaging dialectically with another. Students of Brigham Young University share the responsibility of being religiously literate in multiple traditions as ethical citizens, as charitable Christians, and as faithful Latter-day Saints. Nevertheless, specific complications arise when considering the pedagogical implications and possibilities of teaching religious pluralism to a homogenous student body living in a homogenous environment. This paper will consider theological implications and practical solutions to these questions.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2009 SMPT Conference: Upon All Nations - Religious Pluralism - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/2009-smpt-conference-upon-all-nations-religious-pluralism/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Loading Events](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/resources/images/tribe-loading.gif)\\n\\nSummer Productivity Bootcamp\\n\\nThe Summer Productivity Bootcamp is open to students working towards coursework, publishing, presenting, qualifying exams, or thesis/dissertation milestones.
