I was seven years old at the time (\\u2026) My father, Fred Schultz, was stuck at home with his foot up for more than a month (\\u2026) Like so many others of his station in life, when Dad didn\\u2019t work, he didn\\u2019t get paid. His latest job had been as a truck driver, picking up and delivering diapers. For months, he had complained bitterly about the odor and the mess, saying it was the worst job in the world. But now that he had lost it, he seemed to want it back. My mom was seven months pregnant, so she couldn\\u2019t work. Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker\\u2019s compensation, nothing to fall back on (\\u2026) Years later, the image of my father \\u2013 slumped on the family couch, his leg in a cast, unable to work or earn money, and ground down by the world \\u2013 is still burned into my mind. Looking back now, I have a lot of respect for my dad. He never finished high school, but he was an honest man who worked hard.\\u201d_\\n\\n_Howard Schultz, Starbucks\\u2019 CEO and author of the book: Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time_\\n\\nFor Starbucks\\u2019 CEO, the kind of leader he is directly related to the experiences he witnessed his father go through. His father was unemployed, physically hurt and without medical insurance, and this triggered a strong value of behaving ethically towards employees and ensuring their dignity and self-respect. Whether or not you believe Schultz fully succeeded at this task, by reflecting about his life and experiences such as this one, Schultz was able to learn about who he is and what he values: he became self-aware. This self-knowledge has surely been invaluable to his development as a leader and his impact on the organization.\\n\\nLeaders who are self-aware know themselves: who they are and where they come from, what their strengths and weaknesses are, what they hold as valuable. Personality traits, interests, talents, and skills also fall into the category of self-knowledge that self-aware leaders possess. Becoming self-aware is a process that occurs through self-reflection, or purposefully dedicating time to ponder about who you are and how you relate to others.\\n\\nA leader\\u2019s life story is a key source of information to generate such knowledge (Shamir & Eilam, 2005). When leaders reflect on the events that have shaped them as individuals and leaders, they can become aware of their mindsets, the values that drive their decisions and actions, and their capabilities and potential as leaders. Exploring their life stories, then, is a mechanism for leaders to recall, organize, and draw meaning about their character and identity, which can inform their current role as leaders. From a narrative perspective, a leader\\u2019s life story is a thread of experiences woven together (Sparrowe, 2005) in a way that mainly helps the leader explain three things: (1) whether he or she can and should be seen as a leader, (2) why he or she became a leader, and (3) how this transformation occurred.\\n\\n### How can leaders connect with their life stories and use them to increase their self-awareness?\\n\\nFirst, it is important to carve time for self-reflection. Think about the story you tell yourself about who you are. Potential questions to consider are:\\n\\n*   What events have been most impactful/defining in your life? (Identify at least three events that you can reflect upon and explore more deeply) What makes them salient?\\n*   What themes, beliefs, values, strengths, and/or shortcomings can you observe or draw from these events?\\n*   What words, phrases, or metaphors do you use to describe yourself in these situations/events?\\n*   How can you use this information now in your role as a leader?\\n\\nThese _trigger_ _events_ (Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, & Walumbwa, 2005) can be positive or negative in terms of outcomes, for example, the loss of a loved one, a job opportunity abroad that challenged and stretched the leader\\u2019s capabilities and self-perception, or witnessing a key social or political event.\\n\\nSecond, enlist the help of trusted others, such as a mentor, coach, or trusted colleague with whom to talk about what you have reflected upon and the insights/lessons learned. Information from others also serves as a source of feedback to gauge the accuracy of the self-information you gather.\\n\\nPotential questions to consider:\\n\\n*   If you had to tell this person your story in three acts, what would they be?\\n*   How do they perceive you? What values, strengths, or shortcomings do they see in you? How do these match (or mismatch) with the ones you identified?\\n\\nThinking about your life story can be a powerful way to discover resources and capabilities \\u2013 as well as areas to improve upon \\u2013 that are hidden in previous experiences. Discovering your trigger events can inform your path towards self-development and growth.\\n\\n### About the Author\\n\\nLisa Soto is the coaching lab manager and research intern in LeAD Labs.

You will receive a federal income tax charitable deduction (when you itemize) in the year the gift is made and eliminate part of the capital gains tax you would have paid if selling the securities. And if you have stocks that produce low-yield dividends, you may be able to increase your income.\\n\\n### Give From Your IRA\\n\\nIf you are 70\\u00bd or older, you can make a one-time election for a qualified charitable distribution of up to $53,000 (without being taxed) from your IRA to fund a gift annuity.

Currently, as associate director of admissions at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), I'm tasked with crafting a diverse and small class out of one of the most competitive applicant pools in the nation. My career has ultimately given me the best of both worlds.

As a business professor and associate dean at California State University, Fullerton, she has taught and researched management issues and co-authored papers on women in management and the evolving business school curriculum.\\n\\nNow an Emerita Professor, Dr. Heide remains grateful for the fellowship support she received while a student at Claremont. That's why she and her husband Bill created the Heide Fellowship in 1989. \\\"I got help when I was a student at CGU,\\\" Dorothy has said. \\\"So Bill and I are pleased to give back, and I'm especially pleased that my gift goes directly to helping students.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2: donor-bill-heide.jpg](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-bill-heide.jpg)\\n\\nBill and Dorothy Heide\\n\\nIt is fitting then, that Erin Gore counts herself among those benefitting from the Heides' philanthropy. Thanks to them, her career will pick up on Dr. Heide's work and extend it well into the future. \\\"As a result of receiving funds through the Dorothy B., Janice L. and William H. Heide Fellowship, I was able to take an elective class in leadership. This class provided me with the tools and achievement styles necessary to develop and evolve as a leader. Upon graduating from CGU, I know that I will be equipped with the skills needed to excel both personally and professionally. More importantly, I hope to use the knowledge I have gained to mentor and develop other young women in business throughout my career.\\\"\\n\\nWhile establishing the student fellowship that has benefited Erin and many others, Dorothy and Bill also thoughtfully set up two deferred gifts with CGU. A planned bequest will provide the university with future support, as will a charitable remainder trust they established. In addition, the latter gift provides Dorothy and Bill with a steady current income and tax benefits.\\n\\nFor more information on how you can make a similar planned or outright gift to CGU, please contact Claremont Graduate University at (909)\\u00a0621-8027 or [plannedgiving@cgu.edu](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/#).\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

This line of research \\u202falso includes theory building around the idea of stressor appraisal and mobilization of resources from a longitudinal and multilevel perspective, and its application to organizational behavior.\\n\\n### \\u201cYou\\u2019ve Got Mail\\u201d: The Effect of Email Response Urgency on Response Speed Expectations and Employee Affect\\n\\n_Savannah Leslie_\\n\\nWork-related information and communication technology (ICT) use during recovery hours such as the weekend has posed a threat to employee well-being, as noted in the conservation of resources theory and the effort recovery theory. This research examines the impact that ICT demands have on employee well-being and cognition. Through experimental analysis, I\\u2019m exploring how receiving work-related emails during non-work hours impacts the receiver\\u2019s (negative) affect and their perception of how quickly they are expected to respond to the email. I will be testing whether the urgency of the sender\\u2019s email content (e.g. if a coworker states that they need a response on a project due that week, in a month, or an unknown deadline) and the sender noting when they expected a response (e.g. ASAP, mid-work week, or no note) impacts the reciever\\u2019s negative affect and perceptions of response speed expectations. It is expected that being unclear with the urgency of a message can cause unnecessary distress to employees, which ultimately can affect their well-being and performance.\\n\\n### Catch Me If You Can: A Social Network Perspective of Burnout\\u00a0\\n\\n_Alyssa Birnbaum_\\n\\nThis thesis study takes a new lens by focusing on whether burnout, similar to an epidemic, is capable of spreading at work and what elements impact the spread of burnout. Based on a sample of 40 employees from a data analytics company, this research investigates whether the degree of burnout of connected others is related to the degree of burnout experienced by individuals and whether physical location proximity and the frequency of interactions moderate the relationship between the burnout of connected others and the burnout of an individual within the same organization. Although the direct effect and physical location proximity moderation did not yield substantive results, results from the frequency of interactions moderation suggest that frequency of interactions positively impacts the relationship between burnout of connected others and burnout of an individual when burnout levels of others were low. Additional analyses using exponential random graph models (ERGMs) suggest that employees with higher levels of burnout are less likely to form work ties with one another.\\n\\n### Up in the AIR: Revisiting Boundary Management After the COVID-19 Pandemic\\n\\n_Megan Benzing, Alyssa Birnbaum, Chloe Darlington, Gloria Gonzalez-Morales_\\n\\nThis research explores how the immediate transition to remote work due to COVID-19 impacted employees\\u2019 boundary management. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we\\u2019re learning how people are navigating their work lives with collapsed temporal and spatial boundaries that are more flexible and permeable than ever. Interviews with 40 participants illuminated the increasingly porous nature of work-life boundaries. The transitions in and out of work throughout the day, which we call nano transitions, were often shorter and more frequent than general micro transitions. We found that successful nano transitions are characterized by three components: autonomy, intentionality, and regulation (AIR). This research further delves into the themes that emerged from the interview data and proposes future research that assesses nano transitions in more depth. This topic is especially pertinent as the world of work continues to evolve and remote and hybrid work become increasingly more commonplace.\\n\\n### 9-1-1 Call Prioritization and Appraisal: Does Job Experience and Secondary Traumatic Stress Play a Role?\\n\\n_Emily Zavala_\\n\\nThe thesis study will not only add to emerging research surrounding the 9-1-1 call taker\\u2019s appraisal and prioritization of 9-1-1 calls, but it will also examine explore additional factors, such as job experience and secondary traumatic stress, which have not been investigated. According to Gillooly (2020) revamping current training programs within PSAPs and implementing dispatch protocols to ensure greater consistency in the call-taking process will potentially decrease inaccurate assessments and misclassification of 9-1-1 calls. However, previous research has not taken into consideration the work experience of PST and the exposure to secondary traumatic stress that could affect accurate call prioritization. Therefore, the current study will potentially shed light on other organizational strategies or well-being initiatives that could be used to help PSTs correctly appraise 9-1-1 calls and accurately classify police response.\\n\\n### 9-1-1 Dispatcher Well-being and Psychological Capital\\n\\n_Emily Zavala_\\n\\nA public safety telecommunicator (PST) may be the first contact for citizens summoning aid in a potentially life-threatening crisis. Due to work-related stress, PSTs frequently experience an array of psychological disturbances. Current interventions to combat stress emphasize mindfulness, resilience and efficacy and have demonstrated that PSTs with a positive psychological state are less impacted by stressors. Psychological Capital (PsyCap) looks closely at an individual\\u2019s psychological state, more specifically at an individual\\u2019s hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism. The current study aims to explore how PsyCap could be used as an effective tool for PSTs to mitigate work-related stress. Utilizing a phenomenological approach, semi structured interviews and analysis of Reddit posts were used in the pilot study and determined that PSTs displayed characteristics of all four components of PsyCap, in varying degrees, in addition to other coping strategies such as dark humor, silo effect and seeking therapy. The findings of the pilot study potential allude that the use of PsyCap in training and interventions for PSTs could aid in work-related stress and warrants the need for further research.\\n\\nFlourishing\\n-----------\\n\\n### Emotion Regulation in the Workplace\\u202f\\u200b\\n\\n_Dr, Gonzalez-Morales, in collaboration with Dr. Michel, Dr. Hoppe, Dr. Steide, and Dr. Oshea_\\n\\nA program of research initially developed with a team of European researchers (Germany: Dr. Michel, Dr. Hoppe, Dr.\\u202fSteide; Ireland: Dr. Oshea) on experiential sampling studies that explore the\\u202frelationships between work and non-work domains, and resource-based interventions to enhance employee well-being. This line of research has evolved in several streams. One of them, funded by \\u202fthe Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, and in collaboration with Dr Margaret Lumley, led to the release of a mobile application, Emotion Savvy, \\u202fto train emotional regulation in young adults, developed in collaboration with Emotional Apps. We are investigating how this type of applications can be used in workplaces to improve organizational\\u202fclimate, social relationships and occupational well-being.\\n\\n### Living a Calling\\n\\n_Megan Benzing_\\n\\nThis thesis research studies how living a calling leads to engagement (and lower burnout), benefiting the organization through the enactment of OCBs.\\n\\n### A Social Network Perspective of Work Engagement\\n\\n_Alyssa Birnbaum, Dr. Gonzalez-Morales_\\n\\nThis review paper draws on the crossover model and conservation of resources theory to suggest that the effects of social diffusion and the exchange of resources can impact work engagement and that SNA can help measure those social interactions. Linking several network concepts \\u2013 closeness centrality, density, degree centrality, and tie strength \\u2013 to potential work engagement research questions related to the spread of work engagement as well as the number and quality of network ties, this review elucidates the potential for integrating SNA methodology to the field of work engagement.\\n\\n### A Socio-Relational Approach to Speaking Up: A Moderated-Mediation Model Examining the Role of Relational Energy and Supervisor Organizational Embodiment on the Relationship Between Respectful Engagement and Speaking Up\\n\\n_Dr. Gonzalez-Morales, Alyssa Birnbaum, in collaboration with Anibal Lopez (first author)_\\n\\nBased on the concept of high-quality connections and the tenets of conservation of resources theory, our research examines both the horizontal (i.e., respectful engagement among peers) and vertical (i.e., supervisor organization embodiment) socio-relational influences on speaking up. Using a three-wave field study of 511 employees, the results of our moderated-mediation model support our theorizing that respectful engagement fosters speaking up via vigor, particularly when perceptions of supervisory organizational embodiment are high.\\n\\n### Remote Workers and High-Quality Connections\\n\\n_Alyssa Birnbaum_\\n\\nThis mixed-methods research will investigate high-quality connections (HQCs), empirically testing the conceptual antecedents from Dutton (2003) and Stephens et al. (2012) (i.e., respectful engagement, trusting, task enabling, and play) and day-level outcomes (i.e., engagement and exhaustion) using Day Reconstruction Method to compare these relationships between in-person and remote employees. The following study will utilize reflexive thematic analysis to qualitatively assess HQCs, again focusing on distinct differences between in-person and remote employees.\\n\\n### Careers and Entrepreneurship\\u202f\\u200b\\u00a0 [**(research participants needed, click here)**](https://research.cgu.edu/worker-wellbeing/research/participate/)\\n\\n_Dr. Gonzalez-Morales_\\n\\nDr. Gonzalez-Morales has developed different research projects that deal with career development of young workers: a transdisciplinary collaboration with scholars from Arts, Psychology and Engineering to\\u202fstudy soft skill training in higher education and how it relates to career development; in Argentina, with Dr. Batlle (Universidad de Buenos Aires) studying correlates of career maturity among high school students.\\n\\nDr. Gonzalez-Morales is applying a work stress and gender paradigm to the study of nascent entrepreneurship with colleagues from Portugal (Dr. Neves and Dr. Lopez, Nova Business School) and\\u202fSpain (Dr. Diaz, Universidad de La Laguna).\\n\\n### Presence Scale Validation\\n\\n_Dr. Gonzalez-Morales, Gavriella Rubin, Fabiana Memmolo, in collaboration with external researchers_\\n\\nValidating a new scale that measures the ability of being present at work.\\n\\nBelonging\\n---------\\n\\n### Respectful Workplaces\\u202f\\u200b\\n\\n_Dr. Gonzalez-Morales, in collaboration with Mr. Hausdorf and Dr. Koehler_\\n\\nThis is a program of research for developing conceptual, theoretical and methodological contributions such as reflective measures of victimization,\\u202fdiversity and inclusion; narrative and meta-analytic reviews of workplace incivility; experiments to understand the antecedents of victimization; and theory building to propose a framework of\\u202fworkplace respect.

The study contributes to the literature on diversity trainings and the potential impact that appreciative inquiry can have on both emotional reactions and long-term behavioral changes.\\n\\n### A Motivational Approach to Job Crafting Inclusion Behaviors for Women\\u2019s True Belonging in STEM\\n\\n_Cecelia Dotzler_\\n\\nThere is a known persistent gender disparity in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields that begins at the university level and expands into the latest stages of career trajectories. This disparity attracts attention from scholars from many fields yet requires further efforts to rectify, given the current rate of change would not support reaching gender parity for 130 years. Recent reviews of diversity training initiatives show a lack of consistent results around their efficacy, and several studies suggest that participants of these trainings experience feelings of threat (Pietri et al, 2017). There is an opportunity to explore how positive psychology might enhance the desired outcomes of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and buffer against the unintended and harmful consequences \\u2013 and how doing so from a promotion-focused and appetitive-oriented motivational standpoint might lead to more positive outcomes. Job crafting might be a powerful tool to integrate into DEI work and facilitate women\\u2019s true belonging in STEM spaces. The current conceptual paper introduces the novel concept of job crafting for inclusion behaviors and explains the motivational mechanisms that allow employees task crafting, relational crafting, and cognitive crafting to create inclusive STEM spaces in which women can truly belong and be their unique selves.\\n\\n### Authentic Belonging: A Qualitative Inquiry to Facilitate Women\\u2019s Authentic Belonging in STEM\\n\\n_Cecelia Dotzler_\\n\\nI am proposing two distinct and complementary research projects that will lead to a deeper understanding of the crucial experience of authentic belonging, defined as the resulting experience of inclusion efforts that fulfill both social identity needs of differentiation (uniqueness, authenticity) and assimilation (integration, belongingness). Authentic belonging is a necessary condition for women\\u2019s persistence, engagement, and thriving in STEM fields in which there is currently a stark and longstanding gender disparity (Crotti, 2021). My dissertation research will provide a better understanding of the similarities and differences between men and women in STEM in the experience and impact of authentic belonging. Further, it will serve as a guide for individuals seeking to job craft toward inclusion behaviors with the goal of creating inclusive spaces for women in STEM.\\n\\n### An Early Career Scientist\\u2019s Perception of Communal Goal Affordances in STEM\\n\\n_Ashley Bonilla, in collaboration with Dr. Anna Woodcock_\\n\\nThis study uses a sample of ethnic-minority early-career scholars to examine three aims. (1) Investigate the perceptions of communal goal affordances in STEM (2) Investigate the type of mismatch they experience. For example a negative mismatch in which they perceive a STEM career lacks communal opportunities,\\u00a0or positive, where they perceive a STEM career provides an excess number of opportunities to fulfill communal goals. (3) Investigate how communal goal mismatch type (negative vs. positive) influences their STEM intentions, sense of belonging, and science identity.\\n\\n### Integrative Team Belonging Training\\n\\n_Dr. Gonzalez-Morales, Nohelia Veliz Argote, in collaboration with Dr. Feitosa_\\n\\nDr. Gonzalez-Morales is working with Dr. Feitosa (Claremont McKenna College) on a project funded through a Blais Challenge Award.\\u00a0Nohelia Veliz Argote is leading the WW lab work in this project that incorporates team processes, diversity and emotional management, to create more resilient work teams.\\n\\n### On One Condition: Stereotype Activation and its Role in Prejudice Against Women in Leadership\\n\\n_Veronica Scott_\\n\\nRole Congruity Theory provides an evidence-based framework for how biases against leaders who are \\u2018women in general\\u2019 operate (Eagly & Karau, 2002). However, stereotypes of \\u2018women in general\\u2019 are closest to stereotypes of women with majority group identities (ex. White, cis, straight), and prior research shows that communal expectations of \\u2018women in general\\u2019 are not shared for many Women of Color and Queer women. Thus, there is less clarity regarding how gender biases operate against women leaders who have additional minority-group identities or even specific career roles, for which their subgroup stereotype differs from traditional gender stereotypes based on white cis straight (and otherwise majority-group) womanhood. In this paper, I review the unique stereotype subgroups that result from the intersectional identities of Women of Color (WOC) women, as well as queer women, and I make the case that the traditional gender expectations held for \\u2018women in general\\u2019 frequently fail to generalize to these groups. I then explain how multiple identities and roles can intersect to create intersectional stereotypes. Finally, I illustrate that evaluating women leaders through a simple or an intersectional stereotype will depend upon which one is activated in the moment. Lastly, I suggest future research directions for scholars seeking to apply an intersectional lens (Crenshaw, 2017) to the study of stereotyping and women in leadership.\\n\\n### Appreciative Inquiry to Examine and Facilitate an Organizational Culture of Active Organizational Belonging\\n\\n_Veronica Scott_\\n\\nThis dissertation\\u00a0study uses appreciative inquiry as a way of examining and facilitating an organizational culture of active organizational belonging (particularly as opposed to masculine competitive contest culture). It will used a mixed method design to answer the research questions: a) How might viewing organizational belonging as a positive core, and moving towards this core through positive inquiry, help shape how individuals relate to one another at work? b) What would positive relational practice at work entail?\\n\\n### Moving From Problems to Solutions: A Review of Gender Equality Interventions at Work Using an Ecological Systems Approach.\\n\\n_Veronica Scott, in collaboration with Dr. Vienne Lau (first author), Meg Warren, and Dr. Michelle Bligh_\\n\\nDespite the mounting research on gender inequality in the workplace, progress toward\\u00a0gender parity in organizational practice has stalled. We suggest that one reason for the lack of\\u00a0progress is that empirical research has predominately focused on the antecedents and\\u00a0manifestations of gender inequality in the workplace, paying inadequate attention to the solutions that could potentially improve gender equality and women\\u2019s experiences at work. Indeed, we report here that less than 5% of the relevant studies published in preeminent management, psychology, and diversity journals since the turn of the century identify practical interventions for solving gender inequality in organizations. To advance gender equality at work, we argue that a paradigm shift from problems to solutions is critical and urgent. Using ecological systems theory (EST; Bronfenbrenner, 1977) as our guiding framework, we present an integrative review of gender equality interventions spanning across the management, psychology, and feminist literature over the past two decades at the ontogenic system, interpersonal microsystem, and organizational microsystem levels of analysis. We subsequently provide an overview of domains not currently addressed in extant research (meso-, macro-, and chronosystems) and identify future research directions to spur progress towards workplace gender equality.\\n\\n### Gender and Sexual Diversity\\n\\nWe are working on several projects focused on women\\u2019s emotional \\u202flabor, high quality \\u202fconnections and relational practice; bias literacy interventions to support gender equality in the workplace; workplace experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals (in \\u202fcollaboration with Thomas Sasso University of Guelph, Canada).\\n\\n> Participate in our research,\\u00a0[click here](https://twitter.com/WorkLifeDiary)!\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Research \\u2014 Worker Wellbeing Lab\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/worker-wellbeing/research/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"October 15, 2021\\n\\n_As part of our partnership with the Museum of Teaching and Learning (MOTAL), we\\u2019ve been able to spotlight objects from our collection through MOTAL\\u2019s Artifact of the Month Program.

The very first iterations of \\u2018portability\\u2019 might seem daunting to us now, but at the time they were considered cutting-edge technology.

At a hefty 26 pounds and sporting a tiny screen, the Osborne I was a commercial success and went on to inspire the creation of other portable personal computers.\\n\\n![Image 3: an ad for the personal business changing the way people work](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg3PPnZP-LAb9tpvcGorOZHJnnlVlPSkF2MkELfn6mZUTBW5-vjMp8Posq3ZMBxqYdnNpiEJ7SxHJcWE80Zxh6XnzX8YnNbkijrESkqbDT-bxpsvzxSfdIAf5uGmtoZh5HlfzXqvZnyaLeOGLxAtVIXGUdqDDyvJrngzw5wo1oq0_9sfFdw9w1ssMCb=s750)\\n\\nThe Osborne I is on display in the Paul Gray PC Museum\\u2019s \\u201cThe Evolution of the Personal Computer\\u201d exhibition alongside with several of the earliest portable computers, including the Grid Convertible 1101. This was the very first portable computer that featured the clamshell design where the screen opens up to reveal a keyboard. When closed the exterior case protects the computer, a useful feature for a portable computer. Weighing ten pounds, this was a much more practical portable laptop than the bulkier Osborne I.

Throughout his career, he has treated English history as part of British and European history and has paid specific attention to the British abroad, including adventurers and settlers across the Atlantic.\\n\\nA UK native, Cressy received four degrees from the University of Cambridge before coming to the United States.

I wanted to see if they wanted to partner with us in this exciting work and, possibly, invest in what we were doing.\\n\\nI was fortunate to raise a good deal of funding for these and other projects and programs. It was an eye-opening experience for sure, as people were clearly excited about what we were doing and wanted to help and invest. At that early point in my career, decades ago, it was less common for professors to be involved so directly with the fundraising aspects of their colleges and universities.\\n\\nNow, fast forward to today\\u2026 and, as\\u00a0_The Chronicle of Philanthropy_\\u00a0and other higher education publications have noted, that\\u2019s been changing. More professors are getting involved externally and working more directly with donors often for a very simple reason: Not only do faculty want to inspire and engage external partners in their work, but the donors also want to meet the people directly involved with the projects, programs, centers, and schools they are supporting.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s especially true at CGU.\\n\\n> An incredible philanthropic renaissance is taking place at CGU right now.\\u201d\\n\\nThis fall, the university is receiving an influx of large gifts that includes several that wouldn\\u2019t have been possible without the vision and stewardship of our faculty.\\n\\nIn particular, these include a $1 million gift to the Drucker School\\u2019s Global Family Business Institute from alumnus and former Drucker School faculty member\\u00a0Peter S. Sealey\\u00a0and his wife, Elizabeth.\\u00a0Their contribution was made possible by the great work and friendship of Drucker faculty member\\u00a0Vijay Sathe.\\n\\nI\\u2019m also so proud and happy and inspired by the example of\\u00a0Allon Percus,\\u00a0a professor in our Institute of Mathematical Sciences, who decided to direct $2 million from his late mother Ora\\u2019s estate to establish the Engelberg Fellowships in Mathematical Sciences at CGU in her memory. In addition, Allon is providing one of the lead gifts to create an endowment to honor his late former colleague,\\u00a0Ellis Cumberbatch.\\n\\nWe have several more faculty-connected gifts in the pipeline, and I look forward to announcing them soon.\\n\\nAll of this is a sign of the incredible philanthropic renaissance taking place at CGU. Some of these exciting developments are highlighted in this season\\u2019s offering of\\u00a0the\\u00a0_Flame_.\\u00a0As a community, we are working together to strengthen our university\\u2019s standing as we look ahead to 2025, the year that marks the 100th\\u00a0anniversary of our founding.\\n\\nWe have much to be thankful for at CGU, and it starts with our community, which is one of the most talented, caring, and supportive in the world of higher education.\\n\\nKeep carrying the flame forward,\\n\\n![Image 3: Len Jessup Signature](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-Jessup-signature-400x148.png)\\n\\nLen Jessup  \\n_President_  \\n_Claremont Graduate University_\\n\\nPost navigation\\n---------------\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"When Faculty and Philanthropy Intersect, Exciting Results Can Happen \\u2014 The Flame\", \"source\": \"https://flame.cgu.edu/when-faculty-and-philanthropy-intersect-exciting-results-can-happen/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"THE FAMILY BUSINESS: Ellen and Ben Harper during a sound check at the Santa Barbara Bowl in 2000.

Her consulting activities range from: external evaluator on several OSEP-funded projects; analyst of funding opportunities for a non-profit organization; senior advisor to the IRIS Center, reviewing most of the IRIS modules and tools posted during the last five years and providing input to the overall work; to assisting a university in Brazil develop instruction units regarding inclusive education. Continuing some of the work of the Special Education Faculty Needs Assessment (SEFNA) project, she maintains a database of special education doctoral programs in the U.S. and has presented various findings at the 2020 HECSE Winter Summit, the 2020 HECSE Summer Institute, and a HECSE-IHE doctoral seminar. Smith continues to assist with the dissemination efforts of the IRIS Center. Most recently, she co-presented at the Teacher Education Division\\u2019s Conference held in Texas in 2021. She is currently working on the revisions of two special education textbooks.\\n\\nSmith has directed many federal, state, and local projects and has received over $40.6 million in external funding to support those efforts. From 2007 to 2011, Smith served as the principal investigator of SEFNA project, which was a follow-up and expansion of her 2001 Vanderbilt Faculty Shortage Study. The four-year SEFNA study funded by OSEP to CGU determined that the nation does not have the capacity to prepare a sufficient number of new, highly effective teachers to work with students with disabilities because of a special education faculty shortage.\\u00a0Its results remain the primary source of information about the supply and demand of these teacher-educators.\\n\\nSmith has authored 20 textbooks, more than 30 chapters and book supplements, over 60 refereed articles and reports, as well as many instructional materials for children. She has made many international presentations, including: two in 2022 at a university in Brazil, two Building Bridges Conferences (Belize and Slovenia); and a seminar series (Teacher Education and the Changing Demographics of Schooling) at the University of Edinburgh.\\n\\nShe has received numerous recognitions of her work. These awards include: the Pearson/International Council for Exceptional Children\\u2019s \\u2018Excellence in Teacher Education\\u2019 Award, being a fellow in the International Association for Research in Learning Disabilities, and the recipient of two distinguished alumni awards: one from Pitzer College and the other from the University of Washington\\u2019s College of Education.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nCo-authored with Diane Pedrotty Bryant and Bryan Bryant.\\u00a0_Teaching students with special needs in inclusive classrooms, 2nd edition_.

Having first taught at Stanford and USC, Professor Gray had been particularly fascinated with the impact that personal computing was having on people\\u2019s lives. So, while founding CISAT here at CGU, Professor Gray also began amassing a collection of personal computers with an eye toward tracking both the changes in computer technology and the impact on people these transformations were having.\\n\\nAfter an 18-year career at CGU, teaching hundreds of students, Gray retired in 2001 and founded the Paul Gray Personal Computer Museum. As part of his legacy, Gray donated his collection to CGU with the hope that friends, colleagues, and students would build upon his work in the museum. From miniaturization to portability and to the fostering of individual creativity and connectivity with others, Gray\\u2019s collection provides ample evidence of what most fascinated him about computers: their impact on people. Today, the museum traces the innovative history of personal computing over the last 50 years always with Paul Gray\\u2019s original purpose in mind: for you to see and contemplate how computers affect your life.\\n\\nCGU Stories - Kiera Peacock and the Paul Gray Personal Computing Museum\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Paul Gray PC Museum\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/paul-gray-pc-museum/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Home](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts) \\u00a0\\u203a\\u00a0 E03 The Spirit of Jezebel (Part 1)\\n\\nFebruary 24, 2021\\n\\n![Image 1: scripture unearthed logo](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/02/logo1-1024x1024.jpg)\\n\\nLogo for podcast series \\\"Scripture Unearthed\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2: Scripture Unearthed](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/02/logo1-150x150.jpg)\\n\\nScripture Unearthed\\n\\nE03 The Spirit of Jezebel (Part 1)\\n\\n![Image 3: Loading](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/assets/css/images/player/images/icon-loader.svg)\\n\\nJezebel is the only character in the Bible who, somehow, became her own noun.

WiRED supports the development of a systematic and pro-active approach to advancing global health. Further, it engages in collective action to promote health risk reduction, elevating prevention as a key component of community health. It advances prevention through community education, a strategy reinforcing its view that community health begins with knowledge.\\n\\n**Some of the activities of the WiRED Center at CGU include:**\\n\\n*   Facilitating and providing medical and health education, research and research collaborations at multiple sites around the world\\n*   Disseminating research results through informal sessions, research conferences and publications, meetings, newsletters, WiRED\\u2019s website and outreach programs and other activities\\n*   Enhancing opportunities to secure extramural research funds, programmatic contracts and grants\\n*   Carrying out university and public service programs across the globe\\n\\nThe WiRED Center at CGU has created a formal mechanism to foster new collaborative public health and training initiatives across CGU and WiRED. The initiatives have strong potential for public health impact and could substantially advance the mission of CGU, in general, and the School of Community & Global Health (SCGH), specifically. As a few examples, SCGH strives to provide outstanding training in community and global health, and the WiRED Center at CGU will provide an immediate major boost to its global health mission and will expand its domestic work as well (for example, into under-resourced rural or tribal communities). Some of the major potential benefits of the WiRED Center at CGU to the mission of SCGH in addition to training are to: expand the real impact of SCGH to the health of communities worldwide, expand the potential to develop new more powerful interventions, expand the collaborative base to address a greater number of health issues, and create new avenues of funding to support activities of faculty and students to enhance health worldwide. Because the WiRED Center at CGU will integrate students whenever possible, students will have the opportunity to witness and learn how to implement and potentially lead major public health education campaigns. This will help the new center advance CGU\\u2019s stated mission of preparing students to become leaders for positive change.\\n\\n**Principal faculty members:**\\n\\nCo-Directors:\\n\\nDr. Gary Selnow, Research Professor, SCGH\\n\\nDr. Alan Stacy, SCGH\\n\\nDr. William Crano, Division of Behavioral & Organizational Sciences (DBOS)\\n\\nFaculty members: Dr. Eusebio Alvaro, Jason Siegel, Paula Palmer, Jay Orr, and Dr. Maryam Othman (Western University of Health Sciences)\\n\\n**Background of structure of WiRED:**\\n\\nWiRED International, is a 25-year-old NGO that comprises the structure on which the WiRED Center at CGU is founded.

In 1870, the Mormon-governed Utah Territory granted women the right to vote, 50 years before the 19th amendment guaranteed that right to women nationwide. However, the church's opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and excommunication of vocal feminists in the 1990s were seen by many as steps backward for equality. This is the history that fuels the research and advocacy of School of Religion student Caroline Kline, who proudly calls herself a Mormon and a feminist.\\n\\nKline is working with CGU faculty member Claudia Bushman on an ambitious oral-history project that aims to capture the reality of being a Mormon woman. The goal is to conduct a series of two-hour interviews with 100 Mormon women to record their personal backgrounds, their thoughts on Latter-day Saints' women's issues, and their experiences within the Mormon Church. Kline sees this as a unique resource for future historians.\\n\\n\\\"The story of the Mormon Church has been enormously dominated by men,\\\" she noted. \\\"Women have so often been the silent majority throughout the church's history. Hopefully, what we've put together will be a treasure trove of information on the lives of Mormon women, in all their diversity, in the twentieth century.\\\"\\n\\nThrough conducting and transcribing interviews, Kline is learning about aspects of her faith rarely addressed at a Sunday service. \\\"There are so many fascinating stories. Women's experiences with fertility are interesting - especially decisions about birth control. There are stories about resisting leadership, which interest me a great deal,\\\" Kline said. \\\"But the stories are largely positive. Most of the devout women we interviewed had very good experiences within their congregations. Mormonism has given shape and meaning to their lives.\\\"\\n\\nSupplementing this research, Kline credits her course work at CGU with giving her an expansive view of religion that provides peace of mind as well as insight: \\\"I'm much less filled with angst than I used to be. Now, if someone says something in church that disagrees with my worldview, I step back and say, \\u2018Well isn't that interesting? Why would they think that?' I tend to take a much more analytical point of view.\\\"\\n\\nKline has also co-founded a blog for progressive Mormon women, the Exponent ([www.the-exponent.com](http://www.the-exponent.com/)). Somewhat surprisingly, blogging has played a key role in advancing Mormon feminism. In the past, publishing criticisms of the church could be considered a provocative act potentially resulting in excommunication. Writing on the Internet, however, is less risky, largely due to the sheer volume of posts and the potential for anonymity; bloggers frequently use only first names or pseudonyms (though Kline has chosen to disclose her full name and publish her photo). These conditions have created much more expansive dialogue between and amongst Mormon women, including The Exponent's 20 regular contributors. \\\"The goal is to give women a forum to talk about their experiences,\\\" said Kline. \\\"Their triumphs, their pain, what they want to see changed, what works, what doesn't.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition, Kline is involved in what she considers the next wave of Mormon feminism: activism. In fall 2010 she became a founding board member of WAVE (Women Advocating for Voice and Equality). Among other projects, the group will be issuing collective calls to action advocating for increased participation for women in LDS church meetings. Though she has been frustrated in the past, Kline is hopeful for the future: \\\"One of the strengths of Mormonism is its ability to evolve,\\\" she said. \\\"Mormonism in principle has a dynamic and changing canon. Because we have this idea of continuing revelation, there is a possibility for change. Our leaders just have to be open to the inspiration. There's always hope.\\\"\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting. The information on this website is not intended as legal or tax advice.
