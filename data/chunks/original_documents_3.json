Squirreled deep inside a secret pocket of his handbag is a tape measure. Iannaccone never leaves home without it. It won\\u2019t provide cab fare if he\\u2019s ever stranded or repel a mugger if he\\u2019s ever attacked, but for this artist, it is critical. The portable ruler is a talisman for Iannaccone, whose painting and sculpture for the last 20 years have been engaged with the standards, yardsticks, and benchmarks we use to quantify reality and locate ourselves in the world at large.\\n\\nWith an MFA from Otis College of Art and Design, Iannaccone has been using his art to explore a whole range of measuring tools. Sometimes the measuring units are large conceptual paradigms; sometimes they\\u2019re actual concrete increments. Sometimes they derive from things that are given; sometimes the things are invented. He is interested in the history of these measuring systems, how they work, and why they are necessary. Measure is his primary preoccupation.\\n\\nAfter an early lane change from his pursuit of drama (his acting resume includes Off-Broadway, film, and television credits), Iannaccone switched his trajectory to visual art. He has also included critical writing as part of his studio practice right from the beginning, contributing articles and reviews to a range of journals including _Art Issues_, _Art & Text_, _L.A. Weekly_, _Frieze_, _The Art Newspaper of London_, and _Bijutsu Techno_. In addition, he has written catalog essays for a diverse set of emerging and established visual artists. In 2003, Iannaccone received a Surdna Foundation Arts Teachers Fellowship to develop new approaches to painting and drawing for conservatory students at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.\\n\\nUnderlying all these activities, Iannaccone\\u2019s fascination with the intersecting interests of handcraft, mechanics, and natural history has generated a body of painting and sculpture in which viewers might see geological processes being re-routed through studio operations, artisanal object-making mated with the labor forces of heavy industry, or anachronistic skills being re-purposed through contemporary design. In Los Angeles, his work has been seen in gallery exhibitions at POST, SolwayJones, Sue Spaid Fine Art, Jan Baum Gallery and Shoebox LA, as well as in numerous group exhibitions at area colleges, municipal galleries, and alternative spaces.\\n\\n_Gravity_. 2013.

Revelation plays a vital role in a great number of religious traditions and raises important philosophical, hermeneutical and theological questions in need of conceptual elucidation and clarification. Revelation is a central category in many religions. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Mormonism or Unificationists are difficult if not impossible to imagine without it. For some, revelation signifies a decisive event in the past, for others it is a present reality. It plays a central role in shaping religious identities, and it is the reason for much criticism. Some follow a religion only because of its claim to divine revelation, whereas others criticize it as \\u201chearsay upon hearsay\\u201d (Paine) on which they would never rest their belief. Sometimes revelation is used to refer to a special source of information about the divine accessible only to a few, while in the hand of others it becomes virtually indistinguishable from religious experience or experience in general. Sometimes revelation is understood to be self-communicating and self-authenticating, at other times revelations need mediations and mediators. In some traditions, true revelation is always personal and experienced, and past revelation must continually be made revelation again. Some religions have built elaborate institutions of priests and privileged interpreters to safeguard their revelation, control access to it and to protect the right way of interpreting and communicating it. Theologies have distinguished between natural and supernatural, general, specific and individual, personal and impersonal revelation, between revelation, inspiration and incarnation, or between revelation and divine self-revelation. But claims to revelation have also been criticized as strategies of self-immunization, which allow religions to avoid critical public debate of their views and teachings, or legitimize the position of those in power.\\n\\nThe conference seeks to provide a forum for critical analysis and discussion of the concepts and criticisms of revelation and of the status, role and content of claims to revelation in different religious traditions. Its focus is philosophical and theological, but it seeks to engage in dialogue not only with conceptual constructions of revelation but also with the reality of the discourse of revelation in religious and theological traditions today.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2012 Revelation \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/2012-revelation/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: Bust of Saint Innocent](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/090317winstonsalem.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/090317winstonsalem.jpg)  \\n_Bust of Saint Innocent_\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 1600s  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Italy  \\n**Provenience Location:**  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:** 1990\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Alleged looting\\n\\n**Nation:** Italy\\n\\n**Location:** Stolen in 1990; sold by Antonio Montini (Italian citizen) to antiques dealer in Greensboro, NC; sold to another dealer; sold to private resident; seized by ICE in 2008.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nSculpture: Italian: Bust of Saint Innocent - Bust of Saint Innocent\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2007  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2009  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Litigation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Comando Carabinieri Tutela  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Italy  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Italian Bust Of Saint Innocent \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/bust-of-saint-innocent/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Home](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh) \\u00a0\\u203a\\u00a0 Action Plans and Memory Consolidation:...\\n\\nA large body of basic research on memory, decision-making, and neural systems has accumulated with major implications for improving prevention effects through new strategies. This ongoing study experimentally evaluates short-term prospective effects of new interventions on preventive behaviors (condom use and HIV/Hepatitis testing) and underlying basic processes in a large sample of drug offenders. It is hypothesized that new interventions derived from basic research in cognitive neuroscience will show superior effects on preventive behavior over more traditional interventions. The study is conducted with drug diversion participants in existing drug education facilities. Thus, the intervention components can later be readily disseminated, since they are already tailored to the population and field setting. The investigators have repeatedly shown that carefully tailored basic research protocols are acceptable, feasible, and effective in this context. Community programs, such as drug diversion, are in urgent need of evidence-based, powerful interventions on HIV/HBV/HCV risk prevention.

Zak is a professor at Claremont Graduate University and is ranked in the top 0.3% of most cited scientists with over 180 published papers and more than 19,000 citations to his research. Zak\\u2019s two decades of research have taken him from the Pentagon to Fortune 50 boardrooms to the rainforest of Papua New Guinea.\\u00a0 Along the way he helped start a number of interdisciplinary fields including neuroeconomics, neuromanagement, and neuromarketing.\\u00a0 He has written three general audience books and is a regular TED speaker.\\n\\nHis latest book, _Immersion: The Science of the Extraordinary and Source of Happiness_ (2022), identifies the neurologic basis for extraordinary experiences and uses 50,000 brain measurements to show readers how to create high-impact marketing, entertainment, training, customer experiences, and employee experiences.\\u00a0 The book shows that extraordinary experiences drive up customer lifetime value and provide the neurologic foundation for increased individual happiness.\\n\\nZak\\u2019s other books are\\u00a0_Trust Factor: The Science of Creating High Performance Companies_\\u00a0(2017) and _The Moral Molecule: The Source of Love and Prosperity_\\u00a0(2012).\\u00a0 _Trust Factor_ applies neuroscience to efficiently build high-performance organizations by creating a culture of trust. _The Moral Molecule_ received much attention for Zak\\u2019s discovery of the key role played by the neurochemical oxytocin to explain virtuous behaviors and happiness.\\n\\nZak delivered a TED Talk titled\\u00a0[\\u201cTrust, Morality\\u2014and Oxytocin?\\u201d](https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin?language=en)\\u00a0in 2011 that has been viewed two million times. He also co-founded the first neuroscience-as-a-service (NaaS) company, Immersion Neuroscience.\\n\\nAfter receiving his BA in mathematics\\u00a0and economics from San Diego State University, Zak completed his doctorate in economics at the University of Pennsylvania and completed post-doctoral training in neuroimaging at Harvard University. Zak has taught at Caltech, Arizona State University, UC Riverside, and USC Law. At CGU, Zak directs the [Center for Neuroeconomics Studies](http://neuroeconomicstudies.org/).\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nCo-authored with Bashir, S., Alexander, V., Jiao, P., Johnson, C., & Nadler, A.

Once a Studio Art major at Scripps College, she is now a 2024 MFA candidate at CGU.\\n\\n**Artist Statement**\\n\\nMy artistic explorations are thought-experiments, attempts to learn about myself, my experiences, and the world around me. My practice ranges from painting, to transforming old books into otherworldly dioramas, creating mixed-media installations and sculptures, and creating music and films. Recently, I have been interested in what subtext I can interpret and possibly subvert in old magazines. I have been creating collages that, once illuminated, take on a cinematic quality. By juxtaposing competing images from both sides of vintage magazine pages, nuanced narratives result. The resulting complex imagery peers beneath the veneer of mass media and raises questions about chance and intentionality. For me, it feels like a kind of bibliomancy, similar to doing book dioramas.\\n\\nIn each medium, my art focuses on mortality, transcendence, natural, unnatural, and supernatural phenomena. My goal in all of the forms of art I explore is to suggest that there are endless, open-ended narratives to every event. We are caught in this Gorgon\\u2019s knot and each of us contributes to the unraveling, but none of us can see the totality. I imagine the world as a cosmology that I am illuminating within myself. We are all lanterns glowing briefly in the scheme of things and I want to know what illuminates us and what we are projecting out into the universe.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Tara Tavi \\u00b7\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/students/tara-tavi/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Statistical Mechanics and Lattice Models\\n\\nSpring 2020  \\nWednesdays 1-3:50pm  \\nBurkle 22\\n\\n![Image 1:  ](https://scholar.cgu.edu/allon-percus/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/08/ising.gif)\\n\\n![Image 2:  ](https://scholar.cgu.edu/allon-percus/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/08/coin.gif)\\n\\n**Instructor:** [Professor Allon Percus](https://scholar.cgu.edu/allon-percus/ \\\"Dr. Allon Percus\\\")\\n\\n**Contact information:** CGU Math South, tel. 909-607-0744  \\n![Image 3: a black and white logo with the words alon percusus cgi edu](https://scholar.cgu.edu/allon-percus/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/08/cguem.gif)\\n\\n**Office hours:** Wednesdays 10-11 at CGU Math South, or by appointment.\\n\\n**Course description:** An intermediate-level graduate course emphasizing fundamental techniques in mathematical physics.

It makes itself constantly obsolete.\\u201d \\u2013 Peter Drucker\\n\\nWhat Comes After Success?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nIn today\\u2019s fast-paced world, accomplished executives like you must continuously evolve to stay ahead. That\\u2019s why our groundbreaking PhD in Executive Management (EPhD) program has been reinvented to cater to a new generation of leaders. With a 40-year history of providing doctoral education to executives, the EPhD empowers you to build on your accomplishments and experience by delving into personally relevant questions facing business, management, and society. By joining our trailblazing program, you become part of a special cohort of forward-thinking professionals dedicated to transforming business and society. Guided by Drucker\\u2019s enduring philosophy and supported by our world-class faculty, you will explore transformative ideas that can create a lasting impact.\\n\\nA Unique Learning Experience Tailored for You\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Drucker School and its programs, including the EPhD, are grounded in the philosophy of Peter F. Drucker, widely regarded as the father of modern management. Distinct among business schools, the Drucker School views management as fundamental to human achievement and emphasizes the importance of good management for a functioning society. The EPhD embodies this philosophy by blending theory and practice, aimed at studying a business, management, or social issue in-depth. You will receive personalized guidance from dedicated faculty advisors, ensuring a unique and unparalleled learning experience tailored to your individual goals.\\n\\nThe Next Journey for Visionary Leaders\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nA doctorate from the Drucker School represents excellence in leadership and management research and practice. As an academic, writer, and scholar, Peter Drucker\\u2019s work has left an indelible impact on the field of management. He joined the Claremont Graduate University in the early 1970s, and for nearly 20 years, he and CGU faculty offered the EPhD program, with the first students graduating in 1984. Although many business schools offer similar programs, such as the \\u201cDBA,\\u201d the EPhD at Drucker has a distinguished and unique history as the oldest program of its kind. The newly reimagined program is tailored to meet the needs of today\\u2019s top executives, providing the Drucker Edge and empowering you to join the distinguished ranks of visionary leaders who have shaped the future of business and society.\\n\\n##### Program Highlights\\n\\n*   **The Drucker Edge:** Building on Peter Drucker\\u2019s management principles and his legacy of innovation, the EPhD is tailored for visionary leaders seeking to make a lasting impact by shaping contemporary business management practices.\\n*   **Flexible and Customized** The newly reimagined EPhD is a hybrid program tailored for experienced executives working full time with completion within 3 years.\\n*   **Real-World Impact:** The EPhD, in contrast to traditional PhD programs focused on the advancement of theory, seeks to advance the practice of management. World-class faculty with extensive academic and practical expertise guide top executives to address important practical issues with rigorous research.\\n*   **Your degree is AACSB accredited**\\u2014the highest standard for business education.\\n\\nProgram At-a-glance\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   PhD in Executive Management\\n    \\n    degree awarded\\n    \\n\\n*   Spring, Fall\\n    \\n    program start\\n    \\n*   3 years | full time\\\\*\\n    \\n    estimated completion time\\n    \\n\\nFaculty\\n-------\\n\\n*   ![Image 1: David Sprott](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DSM-David-Sprott-Web-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### David Sprott\\n    \\n    Henry Y.

It was tough from the very beginning. She was from the Roman Catholic\\u2026. She has her own beliefs and I have my own beliefs. But last\\u2014how many years?\\u2014nine years of our marriage, I have never forced her to join the church. And she never forced \\\\[me\\\\] to believe in her own beliefs as well. So that really helped us both to overcome the challenges actually. However, she has seen me, as at one point, I was a \\\\[branch\\\\] president, she has seen me and maybe seen some examples of what the Latter-day Saints, the church members, or my friends, played an important role in bringing her back. So eventually, she joined the church in 2019.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a love marriage\\u2026. My parents were so excited, because they were thinking, \\u2018My son is getting married to a modern girl from Delhi.\\u2019 And then they were all excited. It was a love marriage. My parents never had a problem with anything. But my wife\\u2019s parents had a problem. Because our church and their church is like right in front of the gates, quite opposite our churches, actually. So \\u2026 from our branch we can see their church as well. So their Roman Catholic pastors publicly announce in the podium saying, \\u2018Do not give permissions to enter those white shirt guys into your homes.\\u2019\\n\\nI remember it clearly that my mother-in-law used to say that, but my mother-in-law was very \\u2026 what do you say, conservative, as well. But she went and asked one of the pastors, \\u2018Hey, we are looking for a boy from the other church, which is opposite to the church.\\u2019 And luckily, or fortunately, that pastor, I remember his name is Mr. Amritraj. He said, \\u2018How does it really matter? Christ is one. And we are called into different \\\\[churches\\\\], Roman Catholic and Latter-day Saints. It doesn\\u2019t really matter if the boy likes it. If the boy feels comfortable. It doesn\\u2019t really matter.\\u2019 That really helped them.

He\\u2019d just listen to you, and he was in the moment, in the flow, and I think that\\u2019s because he\\u2019d studied it for so long and knew how to live life in that optimal state.\\u201d\\n\\nWord also spread to many beyond campus, including Martin Seligman, Emeritus Zellerbach Family Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. Seligman co-founded the field of positive psychology with Mike in the late 1990s.\\n\\nSeligman, who received the news as his first grandson was being born, said it plunged him into \\u201cthe profoundest grief at losing my colleague and friend Mike\\u201d even as he was experiencing the elation of becoming a grandparent.\\n\\nSimilar sentiments were expressed on social media by former colleagues and students and in the Hungarian press.\\u00a0_Boing Boing_\\u00a0referred to him as \\u201clegendary\\u201d;\\u00a0_The Budapest Times_\\u00a0and\\u00a0_Hungary Today_\\u00a0hailed him as the \\u201cFlow Theory Architect.\\u201d\\u00a0_Hungary Daily News_\\u00a0celebrated his career and called him a psychologist \\u201cwhose theory conquered the world.\\u201d\\n\\nEarly Years, Move to Claremont\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBorn in 1934 in Fiume, Italy (now Rijeka, Croatia), Csikszentmihalyi was the son of Hungarian diplomat Alfred Csikszentmihalyi (n\\u00e9 Hausenblasz) and Edith Jankovich de Jeszenicze. As a refugee in postwar Rome, he attended the Classical Gymnasium Torquato Tasso and developed a deep interest in psychology.\\n\\nIn 1956, he moved to the United States to study psychology at the University of Chicago and wrote his doctoral dissertation on artistic creativity with creativity scholar Jacob W. Getzels. During that time, he met Isabella Selega, a graduate student in Russian history. They married in 1961, and Csikszentmihalyi taught at Illinois\\u2019 Lake Forest College before joining the Chicago faculty in 1971.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, with his retirement from Chicago, the Drucker School\\u2019s Jean Lipman Blumen recruited him to come to Claremont and teach psychology and management. With his arrival and with the droves of psychology students that headed down to his Drucker office, it was clear that something special was happening on campus. So, when he was given an offer from USC to start his own program, Donaldson said he asked Mike to stay and do it at CGU instead under the auspices of DBOS. Mike agreed.\\n\\nTogether, Donaldson recalled, they thought that their positive psychology program would simply be a small concentration that would fit with the division\\u2019s other programs, but, he added, \\u201cit just took off and, many hundreds of graduates later, it has taken on an incredible life all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2018Flow,\\u2019 Innovations, Publications, and Awards\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi is best known for his work on the concept of \\u201cFlow,\\u201d which describes a state of optimal experience in which one\\u2019s skills match the challenges of a situation, and for his role as a founder of positive psychology.\\n\\nUnderlying much of this work was his innovative and groundbreaking use of pagers and questionnaires to produce a database based on people\\u2019s self-reports of their ordinary experiences.\\n\\n_Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience_\\u00a0became a bestseller in 1990, which presented his conclusions based on that database in a warm, humanistic prose style. His other books,\\u00a0_The Evolving Self_\\u00a0(1993),\\u00a0_Creativity_\\u00a0(1996), and\\u00a0_Good Business_\\u00a0(2003), expanded on his theories in a variety of directions.\\n\\n[![Image 1: Csikszentmihalyi books](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-tribute-csikszentmihalyi-books-v2-800x467.jpg)](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-tribute-csikszentmihalyi-books-v2.jpg)\\n\\nBecause Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s approach generated a cross-section of daily experience, his analysis paid more attention to experiences of positive states\\u2014like enjoyment or creativity\\u2014than many of his predecessors. That work formed the theoretical background of his collaboration with Seligman.\\n\\nTogether, in 2000, they published an influential article in\\u00a0_American Psychologist_, the flagship journal of the American Psychological Association, that introduced the profession to positive psychology. That work was recognized with Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s appointment as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and his selection for the 2009 Clifton Strengths Prize and the 2011 Sz\\u00e9chenyi Prize.\\n\\nSeligman\\u2014who served as the APA\\u2019s president in 1998\\u2014recalled how he asked Mike to join him in writing their pioneering journal article.\\n\\n\\u201cMike had played such an enormous role in helping me prepare my theme for the APA presidency,\\u201d he recalled, \\u201cthat I prevailed on him to be the joint author of that article.\\u201d\\n\\nOther awards and distinctions include his receipt, in 2014, of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary. Csikszentmihalyi also has enjoyed a robust following online; Since the first appearance of his 2004 TED Talk, \\u201cFlow, the secret to happiness,\\u201d it has received some 6,693,254 views.\\n\\n[![Image 2: Csikszentmihalyi and wife Isabella with Zoltan Balog,](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-tribute-csikszentmihalyi-grand-cross-v2-800x467.jpg)](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-tribute-csikszentmihalyi-grand-cross-v2.jpg)\\n\\nLIFETIME ACHIEVEMENTS: Csikszentmihalyi and wife Isabella with Zoltan Balog, Hungary\\u2019s minister of human capacities, at a ceremony in honor of Csikszentmihalyi receiving the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary from Hungarian government officials in Los Angeles in 2014.\\n\\nHonoring a Native Son\\n---------------------\\n\\nWhen they created CGU\\u2019s positive psychology program, Donaldson said he knew Csikszentmihalyi was an important figure in psychology. However, he didn\\u2019t fully understand the international dimensions of that reputation until they attended a European Positive Psychology conference in 2008 held not far from Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s\\u00a0birthplace of Rijeka.\\n\\nWhen they arrived at their hotel, Donaldson recalled, \\u201cthere were cameras everywhere and all these people looking for him. Later, when I was walking around the conference, people kept coming up and asking, \\u2018Where is he? I saved all my money so I could travel here and meet him!\\u2019 It was really incredible.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen Csikszentmihalyi took the stage during the conference, he received a standing ovation before he even began\\n\\n\\u201cThe audience\\u2019s reaction had this real rock star feel to it,\\u201d Donaldson said. \\u201cHere was this famous person from their region, and everyone looked up to him. I didn\\u2019t have a true sense of Mike\\u2019s international impact until that moment.\\u201d\\n\\nLessons and Legacy\\n------------------\\n\\nWith his arrival at CGU in 1999, Csikszentmihalyi founded the Quality of Life Research Center (QLRC) with colleague and co-director Jeanne Nakamura.\\n\\nOne result of Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s work with\\u00a0Seligman on the field of positive psychology was to create several research centers across the country that would focus on the principles of this fledgling field. The goal was to help raise its visibility on university campuses. The QLRC was one of these.\\n\\n> \\\\[Students appreciated\\\\] not just Mike\\u2019s creativity, intellect, and wisdom, but also his humor, warmth, and generosity\\u2014 he could be unstinting with his time and attention. Visitors to the QLRC were often awed by this.\\u201d \\u2014 Jeanne Nakamura\\n\\n\\u201cI am constantly and keenly aware of what a unique and fulfilling privilege it has been to work with Mike in so many capacities here at CGU for the past two decades,\\u201d said Nakamura, who is an associate professor of psychology in the university\\u2019s Division of Behavioral & Organizational Sciences.\\n\\nFor Nakamura, Csikszentmihalyi was always giving with his time and support to anyone entering the QLRC offices on Dartmouth Avenue. He didn\\u2019t have to know them well; he was generous with friends and strangers alike.\\n\\nThat made a deep impression on students, Nakamura noted, and they appreciated \\u201cnot just Mike\\u2019s creativity, intellect, and wisdom but also his humor, warmth, and generosity\\u2014 he could be unstinting with his time and attention. Visitors to the QLRC were often awed by this.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the years, he continued his research and worked on books and articles. As a result, he has been cited often in many places, from the top journals of his discipline to the pages of\\u00a0_Forbes_\\u00a0and the\\u00a0_New York Times._\\n\\nDespite a considerable reputation, Csikszentmihalyi was deeply humble with a low-key style of presentation that put students and colleagues alike at ease. Donaldson said it was \\u201cone of Mike\\u2019s beliefs that his own pursuit of happiness shouldn\\u2019t interfere with other people\\u2019s pursuits to be happy.\\u201d He also displayed a sharp sense of humor, often making absurd or ironic comments in a deliberately deadpan, impassive manner.\\n\\nDonaldson said he had an opportunity to see Csikszentmihalyi about a year ago before his health deteriorated. He seemed satisfied with his achievements and what might be considered his legacy.\\n\\n\\u201cSo often people look back on their lives and express all these regrets about what they wished they could have done. Mike wasn\\u2019t like that,\\u201d Donaldson said. \\u201cHe said he couldn\\u2019t have imagined living his life any other way. He created an environment on campus where people could train to have a positive impact on the world, and he felt really good about that. He was so pleased to see our program develop and grow, knowing it would live on.\\u201d\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nMike C is survived by his wife Isabella and their sons, Mark and Christopher, who teach at UC-Berkeley and Cornell University, respectively.

According to 2000 U.S. Census data, 19.3% of the population (approximately 50 million Americans) is disabled. At the federal level, the Social Security Administration (SSA) processes approximately 3 million disability claims each year in order to provide benefits for those experiencing a temporary or permanent disability. Disability determination is an integral part of claim processing in SSA. Unfortunately, it is common to experience delays during the determination process due to incomplete medical evidence. These delays can have both economic and social costs in terms of negative impacts on claimants who are seeking support to continue their lives.\\n\\nResearch is being conducted in a variety of areas surrounding systems that could help those with disabilities. Some of this research includes the following initiatives:\\n\\n*   Conduct of a case study on Massachusetts General Hospital\\u2019s use of electronic submission of medical evidence to SSA using Electronic Records Express (ERE).\\n*   Conduct of a national research study in the use of information systems in disability health management, medical evidence collection, and disability determination.\\n*   Conduct of a case study on MEGAHIT (Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis through Health IT with SSA and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\\n*   Conduct of a case study on the transmission of live data across the Nationwide Health Information Network between SSA and MedVirginia (a Health Information Exchange) for the request and collection of medical evidence for disability determination.\\n*   System analysis and design of a web-based employment network portal workflow management application.\\n*   Developing a plan and implementation map to increase consumer awareness and involvement in SSA\\u2019s disability determination process.

It\\u2019s possible when you support Claremont Graduate University through your IRA.\\n\\n### A Special Opportunity for Those 70\\u00bd Years Old and Older\\n\\nYou can give any amount (up to a maximum of $105,000) per year from your IRA directly to a qualified charity such as Claremont Graduate University without having to pay income taxes on the money. Gifts of any value $105,000 or less are eligible for this benefit and you can feel good knowing that you are making a difference at CGU. This popular gift option is commonly called the IRA charitable rollover, but you may also see it referred to as a qualified charitable distribution, or QCD for short.\\n\\n#### Why Consider This Gift?\\n\\n*   Your gift will be put to use today, allowing you to see the difference your donation is making.\\n*   Beginning in the year you turn 73, you can use your gift to satisfy all or part of your required minimum distribution (RMD).\\n*   You pay no income taxes on the gift. The transfer generates neither taxable income nor a tax deduction, so you benefit even if you do not itemize your deductions.\\n*   Since the gift doesn\\u2019t count as income, it can reduce your annual income level. This may help lower your Medicare premiums and decrease the amount of Social Security that is subject to tax.\\n\\n### Take Action! Give From Your IRA.\\n\\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\nI\\u2019m turning age 70\\u00bd in a few months. Can I make this gift now? +\\n\\nNo. You must be 70\\u00bd by the date you make the gift.\\n\\nI have several retirement accounts\\u2014some are pensions and some are IRAs. Does it matter which retirement account I use? +\\n\\nYes. Direct gifts to a qualified charity can be made only from an IRA. Under certain circumstances, however, you may be able to roll assets from a pension, profit sharing, 401(k), or 403(b) plan into an IRA and then make the transfer from the IRA directly to Claremont Graduate University. To determine if a rollover to an IRA is available for your plan, speak with your plan administrator.\\n\\nCan my gift be used as my required minimum distribution? +\\n\\nYes, absolutely. Beginning in the year you turn 73, you can use your gift to satisfy all or part of your RMD.\\n\\nDo I need to give my entire IRA to be eligible for the tax benefits? +\\n\\nNo. You can give any amount under this provision, as long as it is no more than $105,000 per year. If your IRA is valued at more than $105,000, you can transfer a portion of it to fund a charitable gift.\\n\\nWhen do I need to make my gift? +\\n\\nWe must receive your gift by Dec. 31 for your donation to qualify this year. If you have check-writing privileges on your IRA, please mail your check by Dec. 18 in order to give us time to process your gift before the end of the year.\\n\\nI have two charities I want to support. Can I give $105,000 from my IRA to each? +\\n\\nNo. Under the law, you can give a maximum of $105,000 per year. For example, you can give each organization $52,500 this year or any other combination that totals $105,000 or less. Any amount of more than $105,000 in one year must be reported as taxable income.\\n\\nMy spouse and I would like to give more than $105,000. How can we do that? +\\n\\nIf you have a spouse (as defined by the IRS) who is 70\\u00bd or older, they can also give any amount up to $105,000 from their IRA.\\n\\nCan I use the transfer to fund life-income gifts like charitable remainder trusts or charitable gift annuities? +\\n\\nYes! If you are 70\\u00bd or older, you may now make a one-time election for a qualified charitable distribution of up to $53,000 (without being taxed) from your IRA to fund a life-income gift. Some limitations apply, so contact us for more details and a personalized illustration at no obligation.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve already named Claremont Graduate University as the beneficiary of my IRA. What are the benefits if I make a gift now instead of after my lifetime? +\\n\\nBy making a gift this year of any amount up to $105,000 from your IRA, you can see your philanthropic dollars at work. You are jump-starting the legacy you would like to leave and giving yourself the joy of watching your philanthropy take shape. Moreover, you can fulfill any outstanding pledge you may have made by transferring that amount from your IRA as long as it is $105,000 or less for the year.\\n\\n### For Those 59\\u00bd Years Old or Older\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re at least 59\\u00bd years old, you can take a distribution and then make a gift from your IRA without penalty. If you itemize your deductions, you can take a charitable deduction for the amount of your gift.\\n\\n### At Any Age\\n\\nNo matter your age, you can designate Claremont Graduate University as the beneficiary of all or a percentage of your IRA and it will pass to us tax-free after your lifetime. It\\u2019s simple, just requiring that you contact your IRA administrator for a change-of-beneficiary form or download a form from your provider\\u2019s website.\\n\\n**Tip:** It\\u2019s critical to let us know of your gift because many popular retirement plan administrators assume no obligation to notify a charity of your designation. The administrator also will not monitor whether your gift designations are followed. We would love to talk to you about your intentions to ensure that they are followed. We would also like to thank you for your generosity.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n1.  Use our tool _Take Action! Give From Your IRA_ to connect to your retirement provider.\\n2.

Cadigan for a new building that will become the home of the School of Arts & Humanities and a nexus for entrepreneurial business faculty and students.\\n\\nCadigan, an Orange County real estate investor and former tech CEO, earned his master\\u2019s degree (1978) and PhD in executive management (1980) while studying under the legendary Peter Drucker.\\n\\n\\u201cDad felt a strong personal responsibility to give back to the schools that contributed to the man he became and to the high level of success he achieved,\\u201d said Maria Cadigan about her father, who passed away in April 2020. \\u201cHe considered it a great blessing to live in a country like ours and have the privileged opportunity to enjoy a level of education like CGU offers.\\u201d\\n\\nThe new building will be located on a two-acre vacant lot due north of the Peter F.

Cadigan believed in the social responsibility of companies\\u2014that every company\\u2019s goal isn\\u2019t profits alone but that each has an obligation to support a functioning society with its success.\\n\\nWith that in mind, Cadigan created a thriving company, Cadigan Communities, in addition to giving back to the educational institutions that taught him. His philanthropy sought to support infrastructural improvements and create learning spaces to enhance students\\u2019 academic experience. He has provided gifts to create buildings at his alma maters, including Boston College High School, Boston College, Boston University, Harvard University, and now CGU.\\n\\n### Largest Gift in CGU History\\n\\nPatrick F. Cadigan\\u2019s $42-million philanthropic commitment marks the largest that the university has received in its 97-year history.\\n\\nOther significant gifts to CGU include $20 million from Masatoshi Ito, Japanese entrepreneur and friend of Peter Drucker, in 2003 in support of the Drucker School (which added Ito\\u2019s name to the school in recognition of this gift). Businessman Ron Burkle provided $2 million to support construction of the building that is the home of the Drucker School of Management.\\n\\nMore recently, in 2020, CGU created a partnership and received $14 million from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians to establish the Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies in the iconic building that housed the Huntley Bookstore of The Claremont Colleges.\\n\\nOther recent gifts to CGU include $4.5 million from the family of alumna Francisca Toery-Kohler, which is the university\\u2019s largest gift in support of student fellowships; $5.4 million from the Koch Foundation to support students working in the university\\u2019s Computational Justice Lab, led by Director Gregory DeAngelo; and $2 million to create the Engelberg Fellowships in the Mathematical Sciences, which supports students in the university\\u2019s Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\\n\\nCarrying the CGU Flame Forward\\n------------------------------\\n\\n### A Message from CGU President Len Jessup\\n\\n![Image 2: Len Jessup](https://info.cgu.edu/cadigan/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2022/02/len-jessup-300x300.jpeg)The world\\u2019s problems are very complicated. No single area of expertise, no single discipline, is enough to solve them.\\n\\nThat is why at CGU, we embrace a transdisciplinary philosophy\\u2014which means we recognize the best responses to the world\\u2019s most complex challenges involve moving beyond a single discipline or field of expertise.\\n\\nThat philosophy of learning without limits or boundaries has trained many of our students for a long time. Its visibility on campus can be seen in the recent purchase of the Huntley Bookstore building to become the home of the Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies, a research center based in that transdisciplinary philosophy and focused on integrated health and well-being.\\n\\nThat philosophy will be enhanced even more by the generosity of Patrick F. Cadigan. We will use it to build an incredible new campus facility dedicated to creating synergies among several different disciplines and professions under one roof, including elements of the arts, humanities, entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership.\\n\\nUnlike much larger institutions, CGU\\u2019s size makes it possible for us to nimbly implement these and other related concepts in tangible and meaningful ways. CGU\\u2019s centennial will take place in 2025, and the effort now underway will set the tone for our next hundred years. It is an exciting example of how CGU is making significant progress in its mission to be a global leader in transformative graduate education.\\n\\nI am so pleased, and I am sure Mr. Cadigan would be, too, to have his name associated with an approach to problem-solving that is central to CGU\\u2019s identity, and that is changing the face of higher education.\\n\\nResponding to the World\\u2019s Complex Challenges\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n### The Transdisciplinary Philosophy at CGU\\n\\n**Nurturing the Vital Connections Between Management and the Humanities**\\n\\nThe Cadigan Building, named for alumnus and benefactor Patrick F. Cadigan, will be unique within CGU and The Claremont Colleges\\u2014a place with a human-centered architectural design that invites collaboration and creativity. It will serve as a nexus for innovation, ingenuity, and transdisciplinary research and will be the new home for the School of Arts & Humanities. Faculty and scholars in business and other disciplines who share a passion for entrepreneurship will also be welcomed, as will those in public and private sectors interested in honing or discovering skills.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Proactive Responses**  \\nto Public Health Challenges\\n\\nIn partnership with the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, Claremont Graduate University is the home of the Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies, a research hub and living laboratory for health and well-being unique in higher education. The center brings together scholars from CGU\\u2019s seven schools and divisions to conduct innovative research on proactive and behavioral approaches to health in a variety of areas, including prevention strategies, chronic  \\ndisease management, and health-driven technologies that provide access to support networks and programs.\\n\\n![Image 3: CGU Map](https://info.cgu.edu/cadigan/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2022/02/DEV-Cadigan-map2.png)\\n\\n#### About Claremont Graduate University\\n\\nFounded in 1925, Claremont Graduate University is one of a select few American universities devoted solely to graduate-level education.

Chief Executive Officer of Deseret Book, gave quite a personal and compelling talk about the importance of asking questions about gospel issues. She also encouraged each Society member to be the kind of person whom others can go to with their questions.\\n\\nDew recounted an experience when she was invited to speak at Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s Department of Mormon Studies. She hesitantly accepted, not knowing whether she would face a hostile audience. She gave her message to a group of faculty, students, and local LDS members.\\u00a0 At the end, the moderator handed her a few of a list of questions that members of the audience had penned, which she answered. After the lecture concluded, she asked for the remaining stack of questions. Dew read them, noting that the questions ran the gamut of gospel topics. These questions prompted Dew to start thinking about the power of questions, and how questions can then lead to powerful answers. Dew began compiling a list of questions from members of the LDS community.\\n\\nBut this exercise was not just a topic of recreational interest to Dew; her own niece was struggling with a testimony. So Dew encouraged her niece to ask questions, and to begin a \\u201cwrestle\\u201d with the Lord for answers. \\u201cQuestions are good,\\u201d says Dew, \\u201cthey lead somewhere.\\u201d Dew testified to her niece, and to Conference attendees, that questions are especially good when they are asked in an environment of faith rather than doubt. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay to say \\u2018I don\\u2019t understand it \\u2018or \\u2018I don\\u2019t even like it,\\u2019 but if asked to the Lord with a background of faith, it can lead to amazing spiritual growth.\\u201d\\n\\n[Click here to read the full article](http://www.jrcls.org/news/story.php?id=293) on the J.

However, previous longitudinal research on tobacco marketing effects has not focused on particularly vulnerable populations or on youth during transitions in later adolescence when tobacco use experimentation often escalates and consolidates into life-long habits. Previous longitudinal research also has not investigated likely explanatory processes (intervening cognitive processes/mediators) through which marketing exposure has effects on tobacco use trajectories. The present project focuses on a vulnerable, lower SES, multi-ethnic (primarily Hispanic and non-Hispanic White) population of youth with substantially higher rates of smoking than the national norm, during ages in which dramatic changes in tobacco habits occur (16 to 20). Something must explain the substantially higher rates of tobacco use escalation in this population, and tobacco marketing at retail outlets in lower SES neighborhoods is one strong possibility.\\n\\nThis project also evaluates key credible explanatory processes, well-grounded in basic research across several disciplines. Some of the most credible processes that can explain marketing effects, not previously studied in this domain, have received consistent support from multiple lines of independent evidence across neural, cognitive, and behavioral levels of analysis \\u2014 not merely survey or psychometric evidence. The study of marketing effects in a vulnerable population over critical ages, coupled with research on some of the most credible explanatory processes, will provide clear regulatory guidance to the FDA about any needs for new regulations on point-of-sale tobacco marketing (POS). Regulatory changes would be strongly suggested by firm evidence that POS has especially strong, explainable effects in lower SES neighborhoods and vulnerable populations. To investigate these effects and credible processes this project implements a cohort-sequential design in 1000 vulnerable youth from a multi-ethnic population in southern California. Three design features in this proposal are especially important to provide strong inference for any link between POS tobacco advertising and tobacco use, which is needed to support FDA policy decisions. First, the design allows the most rigorous testing of the temporal relationship among the variables, to date, one of the key criteria for causality. Second, testing for the intervening variables will provide support for plausible causal mechanisms also buttressed by extensive basic research. Finally, potential confounders and covariates are comprehensively assessed and thoroughly evaluated.\\n\\nThe project provides the most rigorous, potentially most informative study to date about tobacco marketing effects in older youth. Results are likely to reveal why some older adolescents have substantially higher smoking rates (more than double the national average), leading to critical health risks in the future. Thus, the project has a strong potential for major regulatory implications for protecting the public health in adolescents.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Marketing and Explanatory Processes in Tobacco Progression Among Vulnerable Youth \\u2014 School of Community & Global Health\", \"source\": \"http://research.cgu.edu/scgh/marketing-and-explanatory-processes-in-tobacco-progression-among-vulnerable-youth/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Malo e Lelei! Tongans are those people with ancestry to the indigenous people of the Kingdom of Tonga which consists of 169 islands, 36 of which are inhabited. According to the 2000 U. S. Census, there are 27,713 Tongans living in the United States, and of that number, 12,111 Tongans are living in California. The county of Los Angeles is home to 2,058 Tongans, and is the primary service area for the Tongan Community Services Center (TCSC) ([http://factfinder2.census.gov/](http://factfinder2.census.gov/), 2000). Only 37% of the Tongan population have a high school degree, and 8% (lower than the U. S. average) have a bachelor\\u2019s degree. Poverty in the general Tongan community is 27% and among Tongan children is 30%. Comparatively, poverty rates in Southern California are 15% and 21% respectively (APALC, 2005).\\n\\nTongans face considerable barriers to health care, such as, lower insurance coverage and higher language barriers. In one study, baseline screening rates are only 40% for women who had ever performed breast self examination (BSE), 26% who had received clinical breast examination (CBE), and 25% who had obtained a mammogram. More than half the sample believed that a mammogram was necessary only in the event that a lump is found. In the same study, Tongan participants expressed the belief that breast cancer could be caused by illegal use of drugs, breastfeeding, and trauma to the breast (Tanjasiri et al., 2002). Another study revealed a pervasive belief that cancer equaled death, body weakness and toxins were the cause of cancer, and prayer and healthy living helped to prevent cancer (McMullin et al., 2008).\\n\\nTongan Community Service Center (TCSC): TCSC was established in 1988 as a program of Special Services for Groups (SSG), which is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization. SSG was established in 1952 and specializes in working in conjunction with diverse ethnic minority and disenfranchised community groups to develop models for social service delivery and community self-sufficiency. In 2003, SSG initiated a Community Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is made up of five ethnically diverse groups (African American, Asian, gay and lesbian, Latino/Hispanic, and Pacific Islander client and community populations) that review research protocols involving SSG\\u2019s. SSG operates over 20 different human service programs that range in size and scope, with an annual budget of $18 million, and serves as the fiscal sponsor for TCSF. TCSC provides social services to the Tongan community (primarily in Los Angeles) including immigration and employment assistance, consumer and health education, tobacco prevention, breast and cervical cancer education, language assistance and information/referral. TCSC also operates a food program for Tongan individuals and families, and promotes ethnic and cultural activities at the Center. TCSC is led by six Tongan advisory board members who represent key community areas of church, education, and social service, and four community health workers who conduct all outreach and education for the social service programs.\\n\\nContact: Brian Hui, Project Coordinator  \\nTongan Community Service Center  \\n13030 Inglewood Ave., Suite 104  \\nHawthorne, CA 90250  \\nTel: (310) 679-9099  \\nFax: (310) 679-9022  \\nEmail: [brian@tonganla.org](mailto:brian@tonganla.org)\\n\\n*   Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California, The Diverse Face of Asians and Pacific Islanders in California, 2005.

It focuses on the nations\\u2019 culturally diverse youth as it examines neurocognitive, genetic, environmental, social, and cultural factors influencing tobacco and alcohol use behavior in order to develop more effective prevention programs.\\n\\nA collaborative effort, the center joins the newly formed School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University with research partners at the University of Southern California, SRI International, and the municipal Centers for Disease Control in three of China\\u2019s largest cities: Chengdu, Qingdao, and Wuhan.\\n\\nThe PR TTAURC\\u2019s specific aims are to investigate the efficacy of tobacco and alcohol use prevention programs (1) across cultures, (2) within specific cultural and environmental contexts, and (3) among individuals, explicitly examining the role of neurocognitive attributes and genetics across these three areas.\\n\\nNeurocognitive and genetic studies that fail to properly account for the environmental, social, and cultural contexts in which tobacco and alcohol use behaviors occur will likely be unsuccessful in identifying and characterizing key traits. Likewise, studies that focus solely on such factors as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and social norms may reach incorrect conclusions if they do not consider individual differences.\\n\\nInsight into malleable environmental, social, and cultural risk factors provides strong targets for public health intervention at the population level. Understanding the neurocognitive and genetic contribution to these factors, however, is imperative in uncovering the underlying etiology at the individual level.\\n\\nIn addition, a population-level public health intervention that appears to have weak effects overall might indeed have strong effects among a subgroup of the population. It is important, therefore, to investigate individual differences in responsiveness to prevention programs.\\n\\nIn pursuing this research, the PR TTAURC fosters the integration of theories and methods from various disciplines, thereby bridging their unique perspectives to create innovative ways of tackling complex research questions.\\n\\nAmong the disciplines represented by our researchers are social, experimental, clinical, and health psychology; genetic and molecular epidemiology; neuroscience and neurogenetics; quantitative genetics; psychometrics; education; communication; health behavior; statistics; nutritional epidemiology; public health; medicine; sociology; and health policy.\\n\\nThe center\\u2019s\\u00a0Director and Principal Investigator is C.

Irrespective of the difference in teaching styles, professors at Drucker have one thing in common- they all encourage analytical thought. This is one aspect of the classroom experience that I have come to appreciate because everyone is given the opportunity to engage. Additionally, smaller classes and personalized attention at Drucker engenders an atmosphere that enhances the learning experience.\\n\\n**What are your career goals?**  \\nCurrently I am at a crossroads in terms of my actual career goals, but one thing I am certain of is that I enjoy working with people and I am committed to community service. I want to be in a role where I can combine the two.\\n\\n**How will your Drucker degree help you further your career?**  \\nI believe that the program will continue to expose me to different concepts and theories about management, but most importantly it is teaching me how to manage myself. I believe that self-management is an integral part of one's development and if I am cognizant of my own strengths and weakness then I will be in a better position to help and manage other people.\\n\\n**What has been your most memorable experience at the Drucker School?**  \\nTo date, my most memorable experience at the Drucker School is winning a (group) case study competition at the end of a three-day orientation seminar.

Drucker](https://www.cgu.edu/pages/292.asp), considered the father of modern management, wrote about the virtues of \\u201c_trained perception_\\u201d and \\u201c_disciplined emotion_.\\u201d\\n\\nRespective of its ancient and modern contexts, mindfulness\\u2014the concept of deliberately directing one\\u2019s attention\\u2014is what [Jeremy Hunter](https://www.cgu.edu/pages/2706.asp) has been teaching for more than a decade as assistant professor of practice at CGU\\u2019s [Peter F. Drucker & Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management](https://www.cgu.edu/pages/130.asp). Mindfulness is significant, he said, because it \\u201cenhances clarity, focus, and judgment; enables more skillful decision-making; improves communication and interpersonal relationships; and fosters greater quality of life.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the past few decades, science, higher education, and the corporate sector have aligned with what Buddhist practitioners have been saying (and what Hunter has been teaching) all along: Becoming more aware of ourselves and being in the \\u201chere-and-now\\u201d can lead to transformative experiences and positive changes.\\n\\n\\u201cOur lives are full of actions, and those actions bring about results,\\u201d Hunter said. \\u201cAre those results ones we want or do they cause us or others suffering? Oftentimes, because humans largely run on automatic pilot, we don\\u2019t know how we got that result. Sometimes we know how we got a result but we can\\u2019t control what happened to bring that result into being. Mindfulness helps you change the result.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen applied to the worlds of business and leadership, those results can prove critical: the power\\u2014borrowing Drucker\\u2019s terms\\u2014to manage oneself.\\n\\n**\\u201cA Tool Kit\\u201d  \\n**The benefits of mindfulness were first articulated about 2,500 years ago. The _Dhammapada_, a collection of ancient Buddhist texts, read, \\u201cIt is good to control the mind, which is difficult to restrain, fickle, and wandering.\\u201d The texts also state, \\u201cBy awakening, by awareness, by restraint and control, the wise may make for oneself an island which no flood can overwhelm.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight mindfulness\\u201d is traditionally part of the Eightfold Path that leads to wisdom and enlightenment according to Buddhist teachings. Within this framework, early practitioners employed meditation, breathing exercises, chanting, and other contemplative practices to discipline their mind and focus their attention.\\n\\n![Image 1: Adam Smith](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Adam-Smith-225x300.jpg)\\n\\nEighteenth-century philosopher Adam Smith wrote about an \\u201cimpartial spectator,\\u201d the concept of a calm, detached point that could be used to determine moral decisions.\\n\\nOther, later thinkers trod similar ground. Eighteenth-century philosopher Adam Smith wrote about an \\u201cimpartial spectator,\\u201d the concept of a calm, detached point of view that, through self-reflection and control, could be used to determine moral decisions. Nineteenth-century thinker and psychologist William James extolled the virtue of directing our attention and exerting control over our minds as \\u201cthe root of judgment, character, and will.\\u201d\\n\\nAccording to Hunter, what Buddhism brings to the table are methods and tools.\\n\\n\\u201cThe West has had the idea of the \\u2018impartial spectator\\u2019 but it didn\\u2019t have systematic tools for cultivating it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEven William James said that bringing back a wandering attention was the key to self-mastery, but quickly lamented there weren\\u2019t practical tools to bring it about. Buddhism offers a tool kit.\\u201d\\n\\nBut Buddhist ideas were largely unknown to Westerners until the latter half of the twentieth century. During the 1960s and 1970s, as the Apollo missions were rocketing into outer space, other Americans journeyed to India, Japan, and Southeast Asia as \\u201cexplorers of inner space,\\u201d Hunter said.\\n\\nThese \\u201cexplorers\\u201d include [Daniel Goleman](http://www.danielgoleman.info/), a psychologist, two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee, influential business thinker, and author (_Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ_); and [Richard Davidson](http://richardjdavidson.com/), a distinguished neuroscientist, director of the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/), and an expert on the impact of meditation on the brain. Both received their PhDs from [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/) and spent several years in India and Sri Lanka during the 1970s studying Buddhist thought, methods, and practices.\\n\\n\\u201cThey wanted to understand what \\\\[Eastern\\\\] cultures and traditions had to offer us,\\u201d Hunter said. \\u201cThey were disillusioned by a materialistic West. So they traveled East, studied with a variety of teachers and brought their lessons back here.\\u201d\\n\\nEventually, these \\u201cexplorers\\u201d became the professionals, scientists, researchers, writers, and journalists of their generation. Via their work and studies, they began disseminating Buddhist concepts through Western culture over the next few decades.\\n\\nModern science and medicine took notice.\\n\\n![Image 2: MRI brain scan](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MRI-Scan-Wellcome-Images-Creative-Commons.jpg)\\n\\nNeuroplasticity research shows that experiences\\u2014such as those guided by mindfulness principles\\u2014can reorganize pathways in the brain and lead to long-lasting, functional changes. _(Enhanced MRI scan of brain.

Courtesy of Wellcome Images Creative Commons)_\\n\\n**Brain Redesign  \\n**Up until the 1960s, most researchers believed that the only major changes that could take place in the brain occurred during infancy and childhood. At that point, the brain\\u2019s structure\\u2014it was believed\\u2014became permanent.\\n\\nHowever, an enormous amount of research now shows that this is far from the case. In fact, experiments show that the brain is able to change and adapt over a lifetime. It\\u2019s a concept known as neuroplasticity.\\n\\nNeuroplasticity research shows that experiences\\u2014such as those guided by mindfulness principles\\u2014can reorganize pathways in the brain and lead to long-lasting, functional changes. Essentially, the brain has the ability to redesign itself.\\n\\n\\u201cSuddenly the idea that what a person practices could transform their mind became not only worthy of scientific study but it has actually been scientifically studied, and the data has been incredible,\\u201d Hunter said.\\n\\nFor example, researchers at [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/) were able to demonstrate changes in areas of the brain associated with memory, self-awareness, and compassion after subjects underwent eight weeks of mindfulness meditation, according to a [2011 report](http://www.psyn-journal.com/article/S0925-4927%2810%2900288-X/abstract) in _Psychiatry Research_.\\u00a0 Mindfulness training improved subjects\\u2019 ability to focus, reduced their stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression, and improved emotional well-being, according to a [2012 paper](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/44/15601.abstract) in _The Journal of Neuroscience._\\n\\nScience had finally become enlightened, echoing what the Buddha and those who came after him taught centuries before: Mindfulness can help us _re-sculpt_ our perception so we see things clearly and objectively.\\n\\nIt is this clarity and objectivity that are essential to good management.\\n\\n**Educating Attention  \\n**Good management, according to Drucker\\u2019s philosophy, is key to a healthy, flourishing society. And good management originates with managers who have learned to manage themselves before they manage anything else.\\n\\n\\u201cMost of what we call \\u2018education\\u2019 in the West is about educating your rational mind, about educating a person to think better,\\u201d Hunter said. \\u201cBut Drucker wrote a great deal about how we have overtrained people to think and undertrained them to see. And one thing we don\\u2019t see is ourselves in action. If we had a better view of that, we would have a better understanding of what we are actually doing and what the impact is of what we are doing.\\u201d\\n\\nUnfocused, inattentive managers are prone to making decisions out of fear or anger that lead to wasteful and unwanted results. Focused, attentive managers\\u2014those who regulate their emotions and reactions in the face of change and challenge\\u2014prompt wiser choices and more productive results.\\n\\nThese are the ideas Hunter has been teaching to students for more than a decade.  \\nHunter\\u2014who holds a PhD in human development from the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/)\\u2014leads his students through a 15-minute meditation session at the beginning of a class session. \\u201cIt helps to ground people who may have had a frenetic day,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo many of us run around in a half-frenzied state. Simply taking a moment to let attention rest in the present leads to a more focused, productive conversation.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 3: Dividing the Light](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Skyspace-pomona-college-james-turrell.jpg)\\n\\nJames Turrell, Dividing the Light, 2007, Pomona College Skyspace, \\u00a9James Turrell _(Photo by Florian Holzherr)_\\n\\nHunter has taken his students to [_Dividing the Light_](http://www.pomona.edu/about/pomoniana/skyspace.aspx), a \\u201cSkyspace\\u201d created by CGU alumnus and internationally renowned artist [James Turrell](http://jamesturrell.com/) (_MFA, 1973_) that was built on the [Pomona College](http://www.pomona.edu/) campus. Turrell\\u2019s work aims to show people they are [creating their own reality](http://flame.cgu.edu/alumni/looking-light/). _Dividing the Light_ is a pavilion open to the sky through a specially-designed aperture in the roof. However, at first glance it is not apparent whether there is an actual opening to the sky or a glowing painting on the ceiling. The space challenges visitors\\u2019 notions of what is real. Lights programmed to coincide with sunset and sunrise transform the awareness of color. It shows viewers that their perceptions are far more malleable than they realize.\\n\\nTransforming perception of what is real is a central theme of Hunter\\u2019s classes.\\n\\n\\u201cMy classes \\\\[at CGU\\\\], \\u2018The Executive Mind\\u2019 and \\u2018The Practice of Self Management,\\u2019 are not about reducing stress or zoning out,\\u201d Hunter explained. \\u201cMindfulness and self-management are strategic tools. They help people see themselves clearly, and also help people see reality undistorted by their own emotions and biases. Only then can they make effective decisions to meet that reality.\\u201d\\n\\nHunter\\u2019s students have met such realities head-on.\\n\\n**Creating Choices**  \\nOne former student who held a leadership role worked in a department that was \\u201cperennially at war\\u201d with another department. Mindfulness allowed her to become aware of the root of the problem: It was she who was harboring resentment, judgment, and anger toward the other department.\\n\\n\\u201cNot only had she created the situation in her mind, but through this mindset she had perpetuated it and spread it,\\u201d Hunter explained. \\u201cAnd the difficulty between the two departments was entirely her own doing. That was an incredibly humbling moment for her.\\u201d\\n\\nThis moment of awareness prompted her to turn things around. She ended up explaining this\\u2014and apologizing\\u2014to the other department.\\n\\n\\u201cIt took some time, but they reworked the relationship,\\u201d Hunter said. \\u201cLast I heard, they both kind of teamed up to deal with another department they had difficulty with.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 4: Mark Dust](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mark-Dust2.jpg)\\n\\nMark Dust, a veteran of Iraq who was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, learned to manage his condition and find healing through the methods he learned in Hunter\\u2019s \\u201cExecutive Mind\\u201d class. _(Photo courtesy of Mark Dust)_\\n\\nIn another case, [Mark Dust](https://www.cgu.edu/pages/9810.asp), a veteran of Iraq who was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, learned to manage his condition and find healing through the methods he learned in Hunter\\u2019s \\u201cThe Executive Mind\\u201d class. Dust has since completed an [executive MBA](https://www.cgu.edu/pages/1247.asp) through Drucker and is currently enrolled in a PhD program in CGU\\u2019s [School of Community and Global Health](https://www.cgu.edu/pages/5644.asp).\\n\\n\\u201cIf I take my students\\u2019 feedback from the last 12 years, what they frequently say is, \\u2018These tools helped me to create choices. I was able to create choices where I didn\\u2019t see or even think choices were possible,\\u2019\\u201d Hunter explained.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, Drucker students have voted him Professor of the Year four times.\\n\\n**Mindfulness in Action  \\n**In the article \\u201c[Is Mindfulness Good for Business?](http://jeremyhunter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mindful-Is-Mindfulness-Good-for-Business.pdf)\\u201d Hunter wrote for the April 2013 premiere issue of [_Mindful_](http://www.mindful.org/mindful-magazine) magazine, he offered a number of methods to cultivate mindfulness in the workplace:\\n\\n\\u2022 If you feel distracted, practice following a simple object or process (like breathing). This helps with focus. \\u201cYour attention wavers less and you\\u2019re not as easily pulled away by external distractions or internal chatter,\\u201d Hunter wrote.\\n\\n\\u2022 If office gossip and politics are making work difficult, listen to your co-workers and \\u201cconsider what might cause them pain.\\u201d But don\\u2019t judge.\\n\\n\\u2022 If you\\u2019re physically tired, Hunter\\u2019s article suggested you \\u201ctake a few minutes and let your attention scan your whole body from toe to head\\u201d to cultivate more body awareness.\\n\\nOver the past decade, universities, the corporate world, and mainstream media have latched on to the concept.\\n\\nIn 2004, UCLA established a [Mindfulness Awareness Research Center](http://marc.ucla.edu/). Harvard Business School Professor [William W. George](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=275677) led a mindful-leadership conference with a Tibetan Buddhist meditation master in 2010 and considers self-awareness central to good leadership. High-level companies such as Google have hired or made use of mindfulness experts.\\n\\nThe February 2014 issue of _Time_ magazine declared \\u201c[The Mindful Revolution](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20140203,00.html)\\u201d on the cover, citing the \\u201cSilicon Valley entrepreneurs, Fortune 500 titans, Pentagon chiefs,\\u201d and others who promote its methods.\\n\\n\\u201cMindfulness frees us from our habitual, obsessive tendencies to play out emotionally reactive patterns of action over and over again,\\u201d Hunter said. \\u201cMindfulness is like a clutch that decouples our minds from that crazy hamster wheel spinning in our heads. Mindfulness creates freedom and possibility to choose new and more positive ways of acting in the world. From what I can see, the world needs it.\\u201d\\n\\nMore than two decades ago, Hunter needed it, too.\\n\\n**Deep Roots  \\n**Hunter\\u2019s work is also informed by personal experience, which he candidly spoke of at a 2013 [TEDx Orange Coast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-j6Qfj8udg) event.\\n\\nIn the early 1990s, he was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease. Hunter\\u2019s doctor told him there was no effective treatment, no cure . . . and it was likely to be terminal due to organ failure within five years.\\n\\nAround 1992, the then-20-year-old Hunter, a sophomore at [Wittenberg University](http://www.wittenberg.edu/) in Ohio (where he received his bachelor\\u2019s degree in East Asian studies), encountered the book _The Three Pillars of Zen_. It was a gift from one of his religion professors at Wittenberg. The book, written by a Nuremburg Trial court reporter-turned-Zen teacher named [Philip Kapleau](http://www.rzc.org/about/who-we-are/roshi-philip-kapleau/), was published in 1965 and is considered one of the early books in English to present Buddhism as a pragmatic way of living as opposed to a rarefied or abstract philosophy.\\n\\n[_The Three Pillars of Zen_](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Three_Pillars_of_Zen.html?id=KczYq22WAeYC) was \\u201cone of the first books to teach a Westerner how you actually do Zen practice and included very basic meditation instructions,\\u201d Hunter said in a 2010 online [interview](http://www.potentialproject.com/hunter.html) with The Potential Project, a Denmark-based organization that offers corporate-based mindfulness training around the world. \\u201cSo, quite regularly I did this practice over and over again for years, every night before going to bed.\\u201d\\n\\nHunter credits this practice with dramatically slowing down the progress of the disease.\\n\\nSlowing down, but not stopping.\\n\\nSixteen years after his original diagnosis, lab results showed him the implacable truth: He was dying. His doctors recommended life-saving surgery, a kidney transplant. But that presented a problem\\u2014having to ask for help from prospective organ donors. That \\u201cwas like throwing a birthday party with a secret fear that no one was going to show up,\\u201d he told TEDx attendees.\\n\\nAgain, Hunter employed the practices he had promoted for so long. He directed his attention to face his own \\u201cfear, pride, and vulnerability\\u201d to survive the ordeal. In the end, 25 people\\u2014more than a dozen of them his former students\\u2014stepped forward as organ donors. One student, Drucker alumna Laura Newman, ended up a positive match.\\n\\n\\u201cFor me, mindfulness is not a hobby, fad, or something that I picked up in a weekend workshop,\\u201d Hunter said. \\u201cDisclosing the experience of illness and facing my own mortality lets people know that I had to deal with difficult things just like they\\u2019ve had to deal with difficult things. If I were to stand up and say, \\u2018Do these practices because they\\u2019re good for you,\\u2019 who would listen to that? I share that part about myself because I had to do all the things my students are asked to do.\\u201d\\n\\nHunter\\u2019s experiences\\u2014both professional and personal\\u2014have been enlightening.\\n\\n\\u201cI am still very much a learner on this journey.\\u201d\\n\\n**To download and read two of Jeremy Hunter\\u2019s latest papers, click on the links below:**\\n\\n[\\u201cThe Executive Mind at The Peter F.

These models have been shown to be extremely useful approximations to the full Navier-Stokes equations that appear in the study of motion and instabilities of contact lines in liquid films dynamics. Thin fluid films can generate fascinating behaviors: \\u201cfingering\\u201d phenomena, periodic waves, shock and fronts, regular and chaotic structure formations.\\n\\nIf\\u00a0one rotates a horizontal cylinder about its axis, then depending on the volume of the fluid,the fluid and surface properties, the speed of rotation and the strength of gravity, a fluid on the outside of the cylinder may coat the cylinder surface (coating flow). Similarly, a fluid on the inside of the cylinder may coat the inner surface (rimming flow). In both situations, interesting structures and dynamics can be observed experimentally and computationally.Suppose a small volume of liquid is placed inside a horizontally positioned cylinder and it is not rotating, the puddle would sit symmetrically in the bottom of the cylinder due to the gravity field (potential energy is minimized). Slow rotation of the cylinder in an anticlockwise direction would cause some liquid to be entrained. The symmetric puddle would transform into a shockwave-like structure near the rising side of the cylinder. For slow rotation rates these shock waves are experimentally observable and stable with respect to a small tilt of the cylinder.\\n\\n2012-2013, (co-supervision with Chiu-Yen Kao) )\\u00a0Sarun Seepun\\u00a0((Pitzer College, 3rd year undergraduate student)\\u00a0\\n\\nThe individual study project\\u00a0\\u201cMathematics of thin-film flows\\u201d.\\n\\nWe study an initial-boundary value problem for a fourth-order parabolic partial differential equation with an unknown potential. The equation originated from the linearization of a two-dimensional Couette flow model, that was recently proposed by Benilov and Vynnycky. In the case of a 180 degree contact angle between liquid and a moving plate Benilov and Vynnycky conjectured that the speed of the contact line blows up to infinity in finite time. We show that depending on the initial data and parameter values two different regimes can be observed. The speed of the contact line may blow up to infinity or converge to a constant.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n2010-2011, (co-supervision with Stephen Morris, Mary Pugh)\\u00a0Gary Yan\\u00a0(UofT, 3rd year undergraduate student, Engineering Science Department)\\u00a0\\n\\nThe laboratory project\\u00a0\\u201cExperimental study of rimming flow steady states for low rotation speed regime\\u201d.\\n\\nA number of different phenomena seen in the free-surface flow inside a partially filled circular cylinder which is rotated about its horizontal axis of symmetry. At low angular velocities the flow settles into a steady two-dimensional flow with a front where the coating film coalesces with the pool at the bottom of the cylinder. This mode becomes unstable at higher angular velocities, initially to a sloshing mode on the rising side of the coating film and then to an axial instability on the front. At still higher angular velocities and volume fractions, a number of different inertial instabilities and patterns appear. Gary will study experimentally rimming flows in rotating cylinders of different diameters.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n2010(Summer), MITACS-Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program, (co-supervision with Dmitry Pelinovsky )\\u00a0Alex Kulyk\\u00a0(Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute, Ukraine, 3rd year undergraduate student, Department of Applied Mathematics),\\u00a0Daniel Badali\\u00a0(UofT, 4th year undergraduate student, Department of Physics),\\u00a0Steven Pollack\\u00a0(McGill University, 3rd year undergraduate student, Department of Mathematics).\\u00a0\\n\\nThe research project:\\u00a0\\u201cBifurcation analysis of coating flow steady states for low surface tension regime\\u201d.\\n\\nWith students we analyzed numerically existence and stability of smoothed-shock steady states ( discontinuous steady state solutions of Moffatt equations exist for the critical flux value 2/3) of rimming flows for small surface tension regime.

The physical parameters of the fluid (surface tension, viscosity, etc.) as well as the radius and angular frequency of the cylinder can be represented by the non-dimensional parameter e. For fluids of low surface tension, which are of interest practically, e is small, and so we consider the case when e << 1. Numerical results reveal the existence of an increasing number of steady states for e values down to 0.001, which is an order of magnitude smaller than previously published results.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n2009 (Summer),\\u00a0NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research, (co-supervision with Almut Burchard)\\u00a0Guo Weiwei\\u00a0(UofT, 4th year undergraduate student, Department of Mathematics).\\u00a0\\n\\nThe research project:\\u00a0\\u201d Numerical analysis of spectral stability of steady states in rimming flows \\u201c.\\n\\nGuo developed a robust algorithm for computing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a non-self-adjoint operator using shooting method and implemented it in Matlab code.\\n\\nHe currently works in the Model Vetting group within the Market and Model Risk Management division at Manulife Financial.

And as it takes ever longer and is more expensive to get from A to B (for details and metrics, see Schlueter Langdon 2021a), we would certainly entertain switching, if alternatives were better and faster. Unfortunately, there is a data gap: Faster trips require more seamless travel chains (bike-subway-shuttle, for example), which in turn need data chains for optimized connections across different modes and providers of transportation. Today, companies don\\u2019t share data, and therefore, no data chains, no travel chains, no seamless intermodal travel.\\n\\n**The solution: Better data with a dataspace  \\n**The Telekom Data Intelligence Hub team of Deutsche Telekom\\u2019s T-Systems B2B software devision ([link](https://dih.telekom.com/en/t-systems-wins-automotive)) utilized first generation dataspace technology from International Data Spaces Association (IDSA, [link](https://internationaldataspaces.org/mobility-with-ids-adding-the-n-in-npm-to-reallab-hh/)) to create a dataspace prototype to enable sharing of data on vehicles (where located?), customers (any memberships?), and services (dockless sharing?). We also created data chains to harmonise different data, such as static data from public transportation (routes and schedules) and dynamic data from free-floating micromobility (creating \\u201cdata products\\u201d, see Schlueter Langdon & Sikora 2020). Furthermore, the traditional routing engine needed to be upgraded to provide travel recommendations based on specific user profiles.\\n\\n**From app fragmentation to \\u201csuper-app\\u201d**  \\nFigure 1 illustrates our solution of a super-app for planning end-to-end A to B intermodal trips \\u201cpowered by a dataspace\\u201d ([link](http://research.cgu.edu/drucker-customer-lab/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2023/05/TowardMobilitySuper-app.png)). It enables the evolution from a hodgepodge of apps on a user\\u2019s phone with a myriad of repetitive, time-consuming do-it-yourself trip orchestration steps (app fragmentation on the left of Figure 1) to an all-in-one, one-stop-planning and shopping experience.\\n\\n**Better user experience**  \\nHow does it work from a customer\\u2019s perspective? Figure 2 depicts user interfaces (UIs) for the customer journey and the underlying system architecture ([link](http://research.cgu.edu/drucker-customer-lab/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2023/01/MobilitySuperAppDataspace_CaseStudy_RealLabHH_csl-2023-01-03.pdf)). To initiate a trip a user starts in the personalized, digital travel twin UI to enter starting point A and destination B as well as perferred starting or arrival time. While the system is calculating route options the UI is switched to a more traditional map view with a widget hovering over it to provide three recommendations either based on a user\\u2019s travel history or speed-cost-comfort settings in the digital twin.\\n\\n**Real world test and results  \\n**This project was realized as part of the Reallabor Hamburg project (RealLabHH) as a lab of the German Federal Government\\u2019s National Platform for Mobility (NPM) with funding from the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport. This demonstrator app with dataspace was tested with live data from mobility providers in RealLabHH, including Hamburger Hochbahn AG, Sixt, and Tier Mobility, and at the launch of the system by visitors to the ITS World Congress in Hamburg. The result of better data? Better mobility with 30% faster travel speeds and less CO2 emissions.

With a focus on concepts, methods, issues, and applications, it aims to provide the knowledge and research tools needed to conduct and develop translational and transdisciplinary interventions to eliminate health disparities. The course content will be developed in the context of the history of health and health disparities in the United States. Biological and non-biological determinants of health will be addressed, and a range of social, political, economic, cultural, and legal theories related to health disparities will be covered. A number of frameworks will be used for investigating, evaluating, and discussing health disparities research, and these will address outcome measurement issues, policy and policy formation concerns, interventions, and best practices. Health, health-related conditions, and healthcare within individual health disparity populations will be discussed, and the course will focus on integration of disciplines (including biological, social, behavioral, physical, and environmental sciences, and law and economics) to understand science, practice, and policy issues in health disparities research. Classes will begin with lectures from nationally recognized experts in the subdisciplines of health disparities science. Lectures will be followed by guided group discussions and activities to explore the module content, and questions and issues that are most relevant to select communities will be chosen by course participants for intense debate. At the end of the course, each class participant may elect to formulate a work plan for health disparities innovation research in their chosen community.

Dalferth\\nDanforth Professor of the Philosophy of Religion, Claremont Graduate University\\n\\nJohn Schellenberg\\u2019s recently published book The Will to Imagine: A Justification of Skeptical Religion raises the issue of the relationship between faith and skepticism. Is belief in God necessary for faith in God to be possible? Is it impossible to believe in God without having faith in God? Is faith in God based on experience, and what kind of experience supports or undermines faith in God? Is faith in God dependent on a proper understanding of \\u2018God\\u2019, or is it rather a prerequisite for a proper understanding of \\u2018God\\u2019? Is faith in God an instance of having faith in x, and is faith in God analogous to having faith in the new administration? Is it true that without understanding what \\u2018God\\u2019 means one cannot meaningfully believe or not believe in God? Does one need to have sufficient reasons for believing that x before one is rationally entitled to having faith in x? In short, what is the relationship between faith and belief, belief and understanding, understanding and experience, and experience and skepticism?\\n\\nThis conference is an invitation to rethink our usual understanding of the relationship between faith, belief and skepticism. For some, \\u2018skeptical faith\\u2019 is an oxymoron and faith and skepticism are mutually exclusive states or attitudes. Others argue that there is no proper faith without skepticism about faith. True faith is not merely skeptical about skepticism but also skeptical about itself. If skepticism is skeptical of faith and belief, and if faith is skeptical of belief and skepticism, how are we to construe the relationship between faith, belief, and skepticism if we seek to understand what is characteristic of a life of faith, or of unfaith?\\n\\nSchedule\\nFriday, Feb. 12\\n9:00 am\\tIngolf Dalferth: Opening Remarks\\n9:15 am\\tJohn Schellenberg: Skepticism as the Beginning of Religion\\nResponse: Michael Rodgers\\n10:45 am\\tCoffee\\n11:00 am\\tAdriano Fabris: Skepticism, Involvement, Faith: from Weischedel to Schellenberg\\nResponse: Marlene Block\\n12:30 pm\\tLunch\\n2:30 pm\\tStephen T.

Hunter Chair of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University promote a robust and scholarly understanding of Mormon culture and religion through free and open dialogue, original scholarship, graduate education, and public outreach.The Mormon Studies Council works closely with the Religion Department and School of Arts and Humanities to advance Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University. The Council seeks to foster interest in the study of the traditions descended from Joseph Smith in an academic context in which many religious traditions are studied alongside one another.\\n\\nIn partnership with the Mormon Studies Council, the Religion Department has established continuing relationships with the LDS community in our area. The Council advises the department on the needs and interests of the LDS community, consults with the department on the development of the Mormon Studies program, and works with it to sponsor lectures and conferences. The Council also directs fundraising efforts to support Mormon Studies at the university.\\n\\nThe Council established the Howard W. Hunter Foundation to raise $5 million to endow a permanent Mormon Studies program at CGU. The first stage of that effort was achieved in April 2008, with the endowment of the Howard W. Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies. The first occupant of the chair was Dr. Richard L. Bushman, the second was Dr. Patrick Mason, and its current occupant is Dr. Matthew Bowman.The Council actively seeks donations to support Dr. Bowman and the activities of Claremont Mormon Studies. This includes providing financial support for lectures and conferences and for fellowships to current and incoming students in order to attract the best and brightest to Claremont.\\n\\nThe Mormon Studies Council is comprised of local LDS church leaders, academics and interested lay members. It meets regularly with university administrators including the Dean of the School of Arts and Humanities. The roots of Mormon Studies at Claremont date back to 2002. Now, after more than a decade of dedicated effort from Dr. Bushman, Dr. Mason, Dr. Bowman, the Mormon Studies Council and the Hunter Foundation, the framework has been established for a vital Mormon Studies program at Claremont. This historic effort has also provided the template for developing Mormon Studies programs at other leading universities in the United States and beyond.\\n\\nCurrent Council Members\\n-----------------------\\n\\n### Christie Frandsen\\n\\n![Image 1: Christie and Russ Frandsen](http://research.cgu.edu/mormon-studies-council/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/frandsens.jpg)\\n\\nChristie Frandsen is the chair of the Mormon Studies Council.

The Internet has become your business e-infrastructure. The success of the Internet and web-based services is bringing new ways of doing business in a global world and is constantly pushing the frontier with several exciting next generation networking technologies and applications. These calls for increased demand on business managers to better understand the networks they manage and Information System professionals to design, implement and operate these advanced networks to provide efficient and reliable services to their users.\\n\\nThis course is organized into three sections. The _first_ section deals with the core of the course: Internet and TCP/IP protocols. We would begin with a review of the history of the Internet followed by brief discussion of underlying network technologies including LANs and WANs. The design of IP protocol and its function in addressing, routing, error control and basic datagram delivery will be covered. We will also look into why and how IP will change in the near future to IPV6 protocol. Routing forms a fundamental part of the global Internet and we would discuss backbone routing using core gateways, autonomous system routing using EGP, BGP, intranet routing using RIP. Protocol layering will be discussed along with the reliable byte-transfer protocol known as TCP. We will cover end-to-end process communication using the idea of protocol ports and UDP. Application process design using the popular client-server paradigm would be discussed along with socket APIs, DNS servers. A few popular applications like ftp, email, and worldwide web would be discussed as running examples.\\n\\nThe _second_ section would include an introduction to broadband networking and multimedia communications. The challenging issues of integrating IP over ATM (RFC 1577) would be discussed. We will look at Voice over IP and video applications and their use of new protocols like SIP, RTP and RTCP. We would then briefly discuss new quality-of-service architectures including Integrated Services, Differentiated Services and MPLS.\\n\\nThe _third_ section is devoted to wireless data networking and emerging applications. In particular we will cover WiFi and WiMax networks. We will also discuss internet security and firewall design. This portion of the course will explore new emerging research topics like cyber-infrastructure, sensor networks, adhoc wireless networks and Grid computing.\\n\\n### Course Objective:\\n\\nAt the completion of this course, the student should\\n\\n1.  Learn and understand the design, operation and management of TCP/IP based intranet and internets.\\n2.  Apply principles of broadband technology towards multimedia networks.\\n3.  Be capable of configuring TCP/IP hosts and routers with direct hands-on knowledge.\\n4.  Develop business applications that use socket programming to run over the Internet.\\n5.  Students should be able to grasp recent research topics in this area and present that material to any audience.\\n6.  With the acquired knowledge and a little bit of real world experience, you should be able to successfully participate in design, deployment and management of various types of IP networks and applications.\\n\\n### Course Requirements:\\n\\n1.  Regular attendance and active participation in class.\\n2.  Preparation of reading and questions assigned to class.\\n3.  Prepare and present the applications/research papers.\\n4.

You can bring along your laptop with wireless card and plug in. But you can also do all the hands-on exercises in your leisure time for which you will need a Windows 2000 or XP machine connected to the Internet.\\n\\n### Class Participation:\\n\\nThe course is only effective when participants have prepared readings on topics being discussed in class and are ready to contribute to the class discussion. Students are expected to provide their experiences either at work, prior job and somewhere else that relates to Internet technology.\\n\\nBoth the quantity of comments (i.e. how many times a student speaks) and, more importantly, the quality of the comments will be taken into account. The quality of your comments will be evaluated using the following criteria:\\n\\n*   Does the comment represent a solid analysis of facts or just a reiteration of what was said?\\n*   Does the comment address the question currently on the floor, or is it way off the mark?\\n*   Does the comment demonstrate an ability to listen to and build from what others have said?\\n*   Is the point made concisely, or is it buried in a long, rambling, diatribe?\\n*   Does the comment move the discussion to an important area or does it just rephrase what has already been said?\\n\\n### Group Projects:\\n\\nThe class will either organize itself into groups, or the instructor will form groups based on the total number of students enrolled. The same grade will be accorded to each group members. A lower grade can be assigned to a group member if the majority of group indicates (which must be done before submitting the work for grading) that this member has been \\u201cfree-riding\\u201d and not contributing to the group\\u2019s work. Such input must be submitted as a peer review along with the submission of the work. Any such input after the work is submitted will NOT be entertained.\\n\\n### Presentation:\\n\\nThere will be 1 student presentation and their topics will be assigned in advance by the instructor. The purpose of these presentations are:\\n\\n*   for you to document your reading of articles relevant to the course syllabus.\\n*   To demonstrate your comprehension of recent advances in TCP/IP and how they affect today\\u2019s organizations\\n*   To test your ability to present somewhat complex materials to general audiences.\\n\\nThe format of the presentation will be a maximum of 15 PowerPoint slides.\\u00a0 Your presentation will, usually, describe the major issues for the chosen topic or book chapter. Following a brief introduction, highlight and discuss the important facts and issues presented in the article. If necessary, even quote from it to further emphasize important issues. When alternatives are discussed, make sure to bring your own ideas. In addition to presenting the facts and your thoughts, try to encourage and lead a class discussion on debated issues. Try to surprise your classmates with additional information that will contribute to their knowledge and increase their familiarity with the relevant issues. When wrapping up the presentation, make sure you highlight again the major issues and problems, as well as the proposed solutions and recommendations. Each group will have 25 minutes to present including Q/A.\\n\\n### Research Paper:\\n\\nStudents will be required to research on a particular topic that you choose and write a detailed research article. You will work closely with the instructor to choose your research topic. Each student will discuss their findings in class through a presentation.\\n\\n### Policy on Class Attendance and Participation:\\n\\nStudents are expected to attend all classes (and to arrive on time!), except when precluded by emergencies, religious holidays or other extenuating circumstances. If you will be absent from class for any reason, please notify the instructor in advance whenever possible. If you have an unusual situation that will affect your class attendance, please discuss this with me. All students are expected to be prepared to discuss the final project presentation and critique the presentations of others. In assigning grades, both your class attendance and your contribution during class discussions will be taken into consideration. I will be keeping tabs on how active you are in case discussions and other discussions throughout the semester.\\n\\n### Socket Programming Project:\\n\\nThe class requires you to develop a business application that uses TCP/IP socket programming. Details will be taught in class. You may do this project alone or with a partner. Regarding language, C, C++ or Java is preferred and will be fully supported by the instructor. However, you may wish to code it in any other language of your choice (such as Visual Basic, or .NET) but **yo****u will be RESPONSIBLE** for all necessary support and environment issues including development toolkits, compilers and IDEs.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"IS 351 \\u2014 Samir Chatterjee\", \"source\": \"https://scholar.cgu.edu/samir-chatterjee/teaching/is-351/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"MONICA CAPRA\\nHOME\\nRESEARCH\\nTEACHING\\nCURRENT PROJECTS\\nM\\u00f3nica Capra\\nAbout\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nCapra, C.M., R.

Led by expert faculty-scholars from both fields, you will continue the good work began by late Professor Csikszentmihalyi and gain experience applying social science concepts and methods to important social issues through research and practice, preparing you to succeed in an array of organizations and institutions and to make a lasting impact on the lives within them.\\n\\n##### Program Highlights\\n\\nOur programming in Positive Developmental Psychology is built upon the following core principles:\\n\\n*   The importance of understanding positive developmental processes and primary prevention, promotion, and optimization, rather than remediation.\\n*   The need to take into account inter-individual differences and intra-individual changes across the lifespan.\\n*   The centrality of context, especially institutions, settings, and programs that promote positive experiences and characteristics.\\n*   An appreciation of the bidirectional relationship between knowledge generation and knowledge application.\\n*   Promotion of applied research and evaluation so that our work has direct implications for the decisions of individuals, families, schools, practitioners, and policymakers.\\n*   This program is STEM designated, allowing international students who hold F-1 visas to apply for OPT work authorizations for a total of 36 months (an initial 1-year period and a 24-month OPT STEM extension) of paid work experience in the U.S. after graduation.\\n\\nProgram At-a-glance\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   MA in Psychology\\n    \\n    degree awarded\\n    \\n\\n*   Spring, Summer, Fall\\n    \\n    program start\\n    \\n*   2 years | full time\\\\*\\n    \\n    estimated completion time\\n    \\n\\nWhere You Can Find Our Alumni\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n*   First Five California\\n    \\n    Senior Research Analyst\\n    \\n*   University of Miami Linda Ray Center for Early Intervention Research\\n    \\n    Research Director in Psychology\\n    \\n*   California State University, Fullerton\\n    \\n    Assistant Professor\\n    \\n*   Children\\u2019s Institute International\\n    \\n    Program Analyst\\n    \\n*   UC Irvine Health Policy and Research Center\\n    \\n    Researcher\\n    \\n*   Claremont McKenna College, The Berger Institute for Work, Family, and Children\\n    \\n    Associate Director\\n    \\n*   Pomona College\\n    \\n    Visiting Assistant Professor of Psychology\\n    \\n*   Child Trends\\n    \\n    Research Scientist\\n    \\n*   United Way\\n    \\n    Data and Evaluation Manager\\n    \\n\\nFaculty\\n-------\\n\\n*   ![Image 2: Portrait of JEanne Nakamura](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/JeanneNakamura-web-e1478934838522-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Jeanne Nakamura\\n    \\n    Associate Professor  \\n    Director, Quality of Life Research Center\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Engagement, Mentoring, Positive Aging\\n    \\n*   ![Image 3: Portrait of Tiffany Berry](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TiffanyBerry-web-e1478931120222-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Tiffany Berry\\n    \\n    Dean, School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation  \\n    Full Research Professor\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Educational Program Evaluation, K\\u201312 Educational Curricula, Comprehensive School Reform\\n    \\n*   ![Image 4: Kendall Bronk](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kendall_Bronk_WEB-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Kendall Cotton Bronk\\n    \\n    Professor of Psychology\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Purpose in Life, Adolescent Moral Development, Positive Youth Development, Qualitative Methods\\n    \\n*   ![Image 5: Saeideh (Saida) Heshmati](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Heshmati1024x1024-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Saeideh (Saida) Heshmati\\n    \\n    Assistant Professor of Psychology\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Human Flourishing Across the Lifespan, Positive Relationships & Love, Longitudinal Analysis\\n    \\n\\nExtended Faculty\\n----------------\\n\\n*   #### Reed Larson\\n    \\n    University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Developmental experiences in youth programs\\n    \\n*   #### Stacey N.

It includes fifty states with a population of approximately 800 million people. Various geographic, economic, lingual, and political subdivisions create different entities. The European Union (EU) counts 27 member states with a population of about 447 million. There are vast cultural differences between each country, even between regions within a country.The first Mormon missionaries arrived in England in 1837. They found a responsive public among religious seekers in the working class. Converts were encouraged to gather to Zion. In the 1850s, the work expanded to more European countries. Protestant countries in the north, Denmark and Sweden in particular, yielded much better results than the predominantly Catholic countries in the south such as France and Italy. Protestants were more used to religious diversity and Scriptural study. They could also more easily accept the argument of a Great Apostasy and the need of a Restoration. Moreover, the appeal to emigrate to the US made that by 1890 some 91,000 members, mainly British and Scandinavian, had emigrated to the intermountain West, laying a genetic foundation that persists till today. In view of the struggling pioneer period in Utah, it is noteworthy that the church in England took care of a new printing of the Book of Mormon, the periodical _The Millennial Star,_ and _The Journal of Discourses._\\n\\nAfter 1900 missionary work continued, often against stiff opposition fed by religious anti-Mormon publications and by lurid tales about polygamy. The conversion pattern remained: Protestant countries yielded more converts than Catholic ones. The First World War saw Mormon soldiers on both sides of the conflict, but most existing branches endured. After the war, missionary work accelerated. However, in spite of church counsel, emigration to the Mormon West continued to deplete local church units. At the outbreak of the Second World War, all missionaries were withdrawn and local congregations had to survive on their own. Their stories, and from those involved in the war effort, are well documented.\\n\\nIn the 1950s and \\u201860s, missionary work proved fairly fruitful, owing to positive attitudes toward the US and to pressuring missionaries and speedy baptisms. Unsurprisingly, massive disaffections followed. Still, in each country stalwart pioneer converts laid the foundation of strong Mormon families, able to provide more and more local leadership and leading to the first stakes and temples.From the 1970s on, the Church succeeded in establishing a presence in countries behind the Iron Curtain, first through small humanitarian and pedagogical projects. Quiet diplomacy behind the scenes cleared obstacles. In 1985 the Church was able to open a temple in East Germany. Next the collapse of communist regimes allowed to expand missionary work in most post-Soviet countries. However, the initial euphoria did not last when the reinstated national churches, in accord with governments seeking to foster national pride, enacted restrictive legislation to impede the spread of nonindigenous religions. Also, in many European countries anti-cult movements disparaged any unfamiliar sect, including Jehovah\\u2019s Witnesses, Scientology, and Mormonism.\\n\\nBy the turn of the century more non-Europeans than native Europeans were willing to listen to the missionaries\\u2019 message\\u2014refugees, temporary workers, and international students, in particular from Africa. It makes most local church units multilingual and multicultural. However, that internal diversity is supplanted by the strict conformity to the Church\\u2019s worldwide model of uniform organization, meeting formats, and programs.\\n\\nFor the end of 2019, the Church reported 497,436 members in Europe (45 countries listed). It comes to about six Latter-day Saints per 10,000 people. Of those six, less than two are active members.\\n\\n[Back to top](#top)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nLocating Academic Sources\\n-------------------------\\n\\n### Databases\\n\\nProQuest, JSTOR and EBSCO are the most relevant databases for the topics listed below.

The focus is often on the travels and experiences of American church authorities and missionaries and on institutional data. Leadership and male perspectives dominate.

The historian is thus often dealing with sources written from a skewed perspective.[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4) Often missing: how did comparable religious groups fare?The better publications include social, political, and religious factors and pay more attention to the church members themselves.[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5) Other noteworthy books and articles focus on specific regions, church units, or individual Mormons in Europe.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\n[Back to top](#top)\\n\\n### Interaction with government, other denominations, and society\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n#### Religious freedom\\n\\nHow is \\u201creligious freedom\\u201d interpreted in each country and how have laws and rules evolved with effect on Mormonism?[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\n#### Recognition\\n\\nThe concept of \\u201crecognition\\u201d differs from country to country.

The act of teaching alone is not social justice if we are not teaching in ways that honor our students and communities. For us, critical social justice is not an empty gesture or a checklist, but rather a challenging, humbling, love-soaked, reflective practice that takes practice. We operate from the premise that schools are not neutral because they contain and reflect the inequities deeply and structurally embedded within our nation. Therefore, we support our students in understanding this landscape so they can:\\n\\n*   Actively seek and make change that disrupts inhumane, unjust, and inequitable patterns and practices.\\n*   Affirm and empower students (households, communities, colleagues, and ourselves) to harness the resources needed to navigate an unjust world with empathy, savvy, and agency.\\n*   Dismantle systems and practices of oppression and reimagine love-soaked, empowering ecologies.\\n\\nTo enact our values, we developed Critical Social Justice Competencies that guide our faculty\\u2019s and students\\u2019 teaching practices, we elevate scholarship and experiences of diverse voices, and we center collective wellness and community in everything we do.\\n\\nProgram At-a-glance\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   CA Preliminary Teaching Credential and MA/MS in Education or Mathematics\\n    \\n    degree awarded\\n    \\n\\n*   Spring, Summer\\n    \\n    program start\\n    \\n*   12-24 months | full time\\\\*\\n    \\n    estimated completion time\\n    \\n\\nFaculty\\n-------\\n\\n*   ![Image 1: Portrait of Delacy Ganley](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ganley_DeLacy_1000-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### DeLacy Ganley\\n    \\n    Dean, School of Educational Studies  \\n    Professor of Education\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Culturally relevant education; resiliency and achievement of marginalized populations; intersection of families, community, and school; language acquisition; social capital theory; systems theory\\n    \\n*   ![Image 2: Rebecca Hatkoff](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rebecca-Hatkoff-1024x1024-Template-1-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Rebecca Hatkoff\\n    \\n    Interim Director of Teacher Education and Clinical Assistant Professor\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Critical Social Justice Teaching Competencies; Classroom and School Ecology; Effective and Empowering Pedagogy for all Students, Teacher Candidates, and Teachers; Strength-Based Views of Schools, Teachers, Students, Households, and Communities\\n    \\n*   ![Image 3: Claudia Bermudez](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bermudez1024x1024Web-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Claudia Berm\\u00fadez\\n    \\n    Clinical Assistant Professor  \\n    Preliminary Program Coordinator  \\n    Department of Teacher Education\\n    \\n*   ![Image 4: Samara Suafoa](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Samara-Suafoa-1024x1024-Template-1-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Samara Suafo\\u2019a\\n    \\n    Clinical Assistant Professor  \\n    Assistant Director of Department of Teacher Education.\\n    \\n*   ![Image 5: Laureen Adams](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Laureen-Adams-1024x1024-Template-1-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Laureen Adams\\n    \\n    Adjunct Faculty, Allies of Dreamers Certificate program\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Teacher education, urban teacher preparation and resilience, schooling experiences of Black students, teacher and student relationships, teacher care, culturally sustaining pedagogy, critical race theory, liberatory education, healing, qualitative methodologies, Africana studies\\n    \\n\\nCurriculum\\n----------\\n\\n### Pathways to Certification\\n\\n##### PROGRAM LENGTH: 12-18 MONTHS\\n\\n#### Residency\\n\\n*   Emulates the immersive nature of medical residencies with personalized training.\\n*   Earn your credential and MA in one year.\\n*   Provides hands-on classroom experience under a mentor, with progressively increasing responsibilities.\\n*   Unpaid, but district partnerships can provide a $25,000 living stipend and hiring advantages post-completion.\\n\\n##### PROGRAM LENGTH: 18-24 MONTHS\\n\\n#### Internship\\n\\n*   Paid program, with an average salary of $45,000 per year.\\n*   Ideal for experienced educators desiring full-time pay and benefits.\\n*   Candidates find and apply for the internship with guidance from CGU.\\n*   Complete a full year as the teacher of record in your classroom.\\n*   Start in spring with a pre-internship student teaching placement.\\n*   Opportunities to work in local school districts.\\n\\nProgram Components\\n------------------\\n\\n#### Graduate and Clinical Coursework\\n\\n*   **Teaching and Learning Process Series (4 parts):**\\u00a0These courses are virtual and synchronous, blending culturally responsive theory with practical applications.

The views represented below are their own._\\n\\nAbout a month ago, the Claremont Mormon Studies Student Association (CMSSA) had the opportunity to host a lunch meeting with BYU political philosophy professor Ralph Hancock. In preparation for our conversation, we were sent Hancock\\u2019s\\u00a0_Times and Seasons_\\u00a0[blog posts](http://timesandseasons.org/index.php/2012/07/nothing-to-apologize-for-part-ii/)\\u00a0regarding Mormon Studies.\\n\\nYet, perusing those posts, we found that the Mormon Studies about which Hancock expressed great caution did not seem to match up with our scholarship here at Claremont. Over lunch we ended up disagreeing with some of Hancock\\u2019s conclusions about the nature of Mormon Studies and had a lively discussion. Fortunately, however, through the course of our conversation we discovered that some of his caution was about belief in absolute academic objectivity, which we, as scholars, certainly share.\\n\\n[Read the article](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/examining-the-mormon-in-mormon-studies-part-1-of-2/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Toward \\u201cMormon Studies\\u201d: Part 2 of 2\\n\\nOriginally posted April 10, 2013\\n\\n_Part Two was written (once again, by Alexandria Griffin and Michael Haycock) before the posting of Part One -that is, when the authors were still uncertain whether Loyd Ericson\\u2019s article was meant to be prescriptive or descriptive- and was intended as an alternative to the taxonomy of those who could be seen as doing Mormon Studies presented in Ericson\\u2019s paper. Recognizing now that Ericson intended to be descriptive, the following should be read instead as an alternative to the atmosphere surrounding much of Mormon Studies at present (which we feel Ericson described quite well). Indeed, his categories formed a helpful basis for our thoughts as we composed the post below, especially in considering how Mormon Studies has been viewed, is presently viewed, and can be viewed in the future._\\n\\nWe feel that with the inauguration of this blog, it is important that we not assume an intuitive definition for \\u201cMormon Studies\\u201d but instead suggest a more rigorous one \\u2013 even if it will be of necessity provisional, open to critique, and requiring revision and clarification. Further, we believe that in the light of recent discussion contrasting Mormon Studies and Mormon apologetics, we must offer our own contrast; however, we do not feel that this contrast represents the only two options for Mormon academia, nor do we feel that dismissive definitions do justice to the effort and thought that has gone into the production of apologetic work. With that in mind, these are our proposals.\\n\\n[Read the article](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/toward-mormon-studies-part-2-of-2/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Spending Sunday Morning in the Mormon Family\\n\\nOriginally posted April 14, 2013\\n\\n_For Patrick Mason\\u2019s \\u201cIntroduction to Mormonism\\u201d class this semester, each student in the course (all of whom are non-Mormon) was required to attend a full three-hour block of Mormon Sunday meetings and report on their experience.

I mean, really, what LDS gathering\\u00a0_doesn\\u2019t_\\u00a0begin with a prayer? Still, this time it was different\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0very different. This time it was anything but mundane and insignificant. For one of the very few times in my life I had to think seriously about how to respond. And, if I\\u2019m being brutally honest, I was even a little upset with Richard Bushman for even asking it. I still don\\u2019t know if it was a calculated move on his part, but part of me remains convinced that he must have been conniving or scheming, because anyone who knows Bushman knows that that\\u2019s exactly the kind of fiendish person he is. In all seriousness, though, with the exception of the few times when I\\u2019ve been in the company of those who insist on praying vocally at restaurants, this common question had never generated quite so much unease.\\n\\n[Read the article](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/is-mormon-studies-possible-at-a-mormon-university/)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Unusual Excitement - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/unusual-excitement/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Year of Object(s) Creation:**  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Iraq  \\n**Provenience Location:**  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:** 2003\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Alleged looting\\n\\n**Nation:** Iraq\\n\\n**Location:** Unknown, last found in Syria\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\n700 objects - Various objects including gold coins and jewelry\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2003  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2008  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Inquiry/Demand\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Government  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Iraq  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** In Transition  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Government  \\n**Respondent Nation:** Syria  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** In Transition  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Iraqi Group of Antiquities \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/2003-group-of-antiquities-from-iraq-ii/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Mission\\n-------\\n\\nThe Claremont Mormon Studies Student Association (CMSSA) is dedicated to providing academic and social support for students, researchers, and professionals with an interest in the academic study of Mormonism. As an extracurricular extension of Mormon Studies in Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s Religion Department, its main objective is to enrich, enliven, and engender intellectual conversations among students and scholars. To that end CMSSA hopes to assist the Religion Department in preparing young scholars by regularly sponsoring student and scholar research presentations, hosting critical topical discussions that will highlight issues especially relevant to contemporary religious communities, and sponsoring graduate student conferences. Additionally, CMSSA works with the LDS Council for Mormon Studies to foster constructive dialogue and build bridges of understanding between the religious community and the academy.\\n\\nVision\\n------\\n\\nIn a set of ever-widening concentric circles, CMSSA is concerned with contributing to the success of the following: students as emerging scholars, Mormon Studies at CGU, the CGU Religion Department, and finally, the overall landscape of Mormon Studies and religious studies in general. Thus, while its immediate concern is local and is primarily a student-centered organization for those studying and researching in the Claremont area, CMSSA envisions itself as situated within a much larger community. Succinctly stated, CMSSA seeks to be a catalyst in establishing Claremont as a center of scholarship on the thought, practice, history, and culture of Mormonism.\\n\\nSocial Interactions\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn addition to its commitment to offering support for individuals engaged in scholarly pursuits, CMSSA desires to foster a social dynamic in which members of the group can assist one another in facing the shared challenges in their respective fields of study and managing the tension that is often experienced by those committed to a life of the mind and a life of faith. As such, the association will host regular activities for students that will provide a forum to address such issues. In addition, it will sponsor non-academic social events for friends and family members. Through these interactions, CMSSA hopes to contribute to a stronger sense of camaraderie, community, and solidarity both as students with shared interests and as members of the Claremont academic community.\\n\\nMembership and Leadership\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAll current students at Claremont Graduate University and its associated institutions are welcome to join CMSSA. Membership is free, and is open to all students regardless of academic department or religious affiliation (or lack thereof). At the end of each academic year CMSSA members elect their own leadership, including at least a President and Vice-President, who then serve for the next academic year.\\n\\n![Image 1: Friends of CMS](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/FB-friends-logo.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Student Association - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-association/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Do Companies Need Vision Statements?](https://flame.cgu.edu/do-companies-need-vision-statements/)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA company\\u2019s mission statement is never enough, say the authors of a new book on management styles.

We were three boys born to them. Big brother is just three years older than us. We three were constantly naughty kids. Apparently strict discipline was the only way to raise us. My father treated us as soldiers. Two slices of bread a day was the norm, so you shouldn\\u2019t eat more than that. We had to stay home, and since we had no sisters it was our job to clean the house and cook when the parents come from work in the evening. Sometimes my father smacked us.\\n\\nAs we were close in age, we had closer relationship and made our own rules about chores: the one who gets up late makes the bed, an early bird puts on nice clothes and so forth quite playful rules. My twin brother and I studied together in school and we were always together from young age until I went on a mission and my twin went to serve army.  \\nThen on we pursued separate lives. When I returned from the mission, my twin got married. Then I got married to my wife. As Mongolia is patriarchal society, men predominate in roles of political leadership, traditions dictate you should respect your parents. The important thing I learned from my parents was to love, respect, and listen to the elderly, and I also learned that their legacy is useful in life. Another thing I learned from my family was that we can also learn from younger siblings. Now I have my own child. I want to listen to my child and be his best friend and I will apply what I have learned from life.\\n\\n![Image 2: Bayartsogt Lkhagvajav](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/06/Bayartsogt-2.jpeg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Bayartsogt Lkhagvajav - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/lkhagvajav/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Make a Gift Tax-Free With An IRA\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nA Tax-Saving Way to Help Claremont Graduate University\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMake a difference today and save on taxes. It\\u2019s possible when you support Claremont Graduate University through your IRA.\\n\\n### A Special Opportunity for Those 70\\u00bd Years Old and Older\\n\\nYou can give any amount (up to a maximum of $105,000) per year from your IRA directly to a qualified charity such as Claremont Graduate University without having to pay income taxes on the money. Gifts of any value $105,000 or less are eligible for this benefit and you can feel good knowing that you are making a difference at CGU. This popular gift option is commonly called the IRA charitable rollover, but you may also see it referred to as a qualified charitable distribution, or QCD for short.\\n\\n#### Why Consider This Gift?\\n\\n*   Your gift will be put to use today, allowing you to see the difference your donation is making.\\n*   Beginning in the year you turn 73, you can use your gift to satisfy all or part of your required minimum distribution (RMD).\\n*   You pay no income taxes on the gift. The transfer generates neither taxable income nor a tax deduction, so you benefit even if you do not itemize your deductions.\\n*   Since the gift doesn\\u2019t count as income, it can reduce your annual income level. This may help lower your Medicare premiums and decrease the amount of Social Security that is subject to tax.\\n\\n### Take Action! Give From Your IRA.\\n\\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\nI\\u2019m turning age 70\\u00bd in a few months. Can I make this gift now? +\\n\\nNo. You must be 70\\u00bd by the date you make the gift.\\n\\nI have several retirement accounts\\u2014some are pensions and some are IRAs. Does it matter which retirement account I use? +\\n\\nYes. Direct gifts to a qualified charity can be made only from an IRA. Under certain circumstances, however, you may be able to roll assets from a pension, profit sharing, 401(k), or 403(b) plan into an IRA and then make the transfer from the IRA directly to Claremont Graduate University. To determine if a rollover to an IRA is available for your plan, speak with your plan administrator.\\n\\nCan my gift be used as my required minimum distribution? +\\n\\nYes, absolutely. Beginning in the year you turn 73, you can use your gift to satisfy all or part of your RMD.\\n\\nDo I need to give my entire IRA to be eligible for the tax benefits? +\\n\\nNo. You can give any amount under this provision, as long as it is no more than $105,000 per year. If your IRA is valued at more than $105,000, you can transfer a portion of it to fund a charitable gift.\\n\\nWhen do I need to make my gift? +\\n\\nWe must receive your gift by Dec. 31 for your donation to qualify this year. If you have check-writing privileges on your IRA, please mail your check by Dec. 18 in order to give us time to process your gift before the end of the year.\\n\\nI have two charities I want to support. Can I give $105,000 from my IRA to each? +\\n\\nNo. Under the law, you can give a maximum of $105,000 per year. For example, you can give each organization $52,500 this year or any other combination that totals $105,000 or less. Any amount of more than $105,000 in one year must be reported as taxable income.\\n\\nMy spouse and I would like to give more than $105,000. How can we do that? +\\n\\nIf you have a spouse (as defined by the IRS) who is 70\\u00bd or older, they can also give any amount up to $105,000 from their IRA.\\n\\nCan I use the transfer to fund life-income gifts like charitable remainder trusts or charitable gift annuities? +\\n\\nYes! If you are 70\\u00bd or older, you may now make a one-time election for a qualified charitable distribution of up to $53,000 (without being taxed) from your IRA to fund a life-income gift. Some limitations apply, so contact us for more details and a personalized illustration at no obligation.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve already named Claremont Graduate University as the beneficiary of my IRA. What are the benefits if I make a gift now instead of after my lifetime? +\\n\\nBy making a gift this year of any amount up to $105,000 from your IRA, you can see your philanthropic dollars at work. You are jump-starting the legacy you would like to leave and giving yourself the joy of watching your philanthropy take shape. Moreover, you can fulfill any outstanding pledge you may have made by transferring that amount from your IRA as long as it is $105,000 or less for the year.\\n\\n### For Those 59\\u00bd Years Old or Older\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re at least 59\\u00bd years old, you can take a distribution and then make a gift from your IRA without penalty. If you itemize your deductions, you can take a charitable deduction for the amount of your gift.\\n\\n### At Any Age\\n\\nNo matter your age, you can designate Claremont Graduate University as the beneficiary of all or a percentage of your IRA and it will pass to us tax-free after your lifetime. It\\u2019s simple, just requiring that you contact your IRA administrator for a change-of-beneficiary form or download a form from your provider\\u2019s website.\\n\\n**Tip:** It\\u2019s critical to let us know of your gift because many popular retirement plan administrators assume no obligation to notify a charity of your designation. The administrator also will not monitor whether your gift designations are followed. We would love to talk to you about your intentions to ensure that they are followed. We would also like to thank you for your generosity.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n1.  Use our tool _Take Action! Give From Your IRA_ to connect to your retirement provider.\\n2.

Hunter Chair of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University promote a robust and scholarly understanding of Mormon culture and religion through free and open dialogue, original scholarship, graduate education, and public outreach.The Mormon Studies Council works closely with the Religion Department and School of Arts and Humanities to advance Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University. The Council seeks to foster interest in the study of the traditions descended from Joseph Smith in an academic context in which many religious traditions are studied alongside one another.\\n\\nIn partnership with the Mormon Studies Council, the Religion Department has established continuing relationships with the LDS community in our area. The Council advises the department on the needs and interests of the LDS community, consults with the department on the development of the Mormon Studies program, and works with it to sponsor lectures and conferences. The Council also directs fundraising efforts to support Mormon Studies at the university.\\n\\nThe Council established the Howard W. Hunter Foundation to raise $5 million to endow a permanent Mormon Studies program at CGU. The first stage of that effort was achieved in April 2008, with the endowment of the Howard W. Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies. The first occupant of the chair was Dr. Richard L. Bushman, the second was Dr. Patrick Mason, and its current occupant is Dr. Matthew Bowman.The Council actively seeks donations to support Dr. Bowman and the activities of Claremont Mormon Studies. This includes providing financial support for lectures and conferences and for fellowships to current and incoming students in order to attract the best and brightest to Claremont.\\n\\nThe Mormon Studies Council is comprised of local LDS church leaders, academics and interested lay members. It meets regularly with university administrators including the Dean of the School of Arts and Humanities. The roots of Mormon Studies at Claremont date back to 2002. Now, after more than a decade of dedicated effort from Dr. Bushman, Dr. Mason, Dr. Bowman, the Mormon Studies Council and the Hunter Foundation, the framework has been established for a vital Mormon Studies program at Claremont. This historic effort has also provided the template for developing Mormon Studies programs at other leading universities in the United States and beyond.\\n\\nCurrent Council Members\\n-----------------------\\n\\n### Christie Frandsen\\n\\n![Image 1: Christie and Russ Frandsen](http://research.cgu.edu/mormon-studies-council/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/frandsens.jpg)\\n\\nChristie Frandsen is the chair of the Mormon Studies Council.

Through a humanistic social science approach, Dozier examines how urban space is historically constituted as a site of carceral violence and is reimagined through expansive appeals for reparative and liberatory futures. Dozier engages with the fields of Black studies, urban geography, policing and carceral studies, abolition studies, cultural studies, indigenous studies, and racial capitalism.\\n\\nDozier is completing a manuscript entitled, _Another City Is Possible: Skid Row and the Contested Development of Los Angeles, 1950-2020_, which investigates how unhoused and poor people at the site of Skid Row reshape the penal organization of their lives by combatting serial containment and dispossession. In so doing, unhoused and poor people have ushered in the contested development of the city by producing abolitionist alternatives to urban social life. These abolitionist alternatives combat elite visions of urban redevelopment that have facilitated Los Angeles carceral and surveillance expansion. Thus, unhoused and poor people push for an urban future seeped in the possibility of collective repair and spatial transformation.

Drucker Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management (the Drucker School) at Claremont Graduate University (CGU) invites qualified applicants for a clinical faculty position in finance.

The applicant will deliver an integral part of the curriculum for these programs, including the core Corporate Finance classes as well as elective courses.\\n\\n**Qualifications.** Candidates must have completed a doctoral degree and must have at least four years of postdoctoral teaching experience at the graduate/executive level.

Preference will be given to candidates who have experience teaching corporate finance, particularly at the MBA and/or executive levels.\\u00a0 Preference will also be given to prior MBA experience teaching finance electives.\\u00a0 In addition, the school is planning on doctoral program growth, thus preferred candidates are expected to be interested in supporting doctoral education. A portion of the teaching assignment may be virtual and preference will be given to faculty with experience teaching in diverse modalities.\\n\\nRegarding service, the successful applicant will be expected to make service contributions to the school, university, community, and profession. Further, the Drucker School and CGU prides itself on a small, congenial faculty.\\u00a0 Preferred applicants will be those who have experience with and effectiveness in various forms of service, along with applicants who demonstrate that they are collegial, can collaborate across departments and schools, and are motivated to establish high quality relations with members of our faculty, student, staff, and the broader Drucker community.\\n\\nFinally, candidates preferably would be aligned with the Drucker perspective on management. In particular, his humanistic-centered approach combined with a deep sense of the responsibilities of organizations to improve the functioning of society.\\u00a0 Ideal candidates would also be expected to value and express an interest in the practice of management. This interest can take a variety of forms including teaching, research, and service activities.\\n\\n**The Drucker School:** The Drucker School is one of five schools within CGU and is named after Peter F. Drucker (who served as a faculty member here for over forty years), widely considered the most influential thinker on management of our time. Grounded in a liberal arts tradition, the school is small, interdisciplinary, and composed a single faculty.\\u00a0 The Drucker School stands out among business schools with its unique focus on management as fundamental to human achievement and its grounding in the works of Peter Drucker. We embrace Drucker\\u2019s core belief that responsible management is the backbone of a functioning society. Further, we believe that firms and managers must prioritize human thriving in their organizations and focus on both purpose and performance\\u2014ideas that are more important now than ever.\\u00a0 Our class sizes are small and, as a result, the classroom is a more personalized experience.\\u00a0 More details about our school, its vision, mission, and goals can be found in our most recent strategic plan ([https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/about/strategic-plan/](https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/about/strategic-plan/)).\\n\\n**About CGU and Claremont:** CGU is an independent liberal arts institution devoted entirely to graduate study. CGU is a member of The Claremont Colleges, a highly regarded cluster of seven independent colleges that is nationally and internationally renowned for academic excellence.\\u00a0 Given the transdisciplinary nature of graduate education at CGU, scholars whose research and teaching engages multiple fields and crosses disciplinary boundaries, and who are willing to mentor students beyond the areas of their own specialized research expertise, will find the Drucker School and the university a particularly satisfying intellectual home.\\u00a0 CGU and the Claremont Colleges are located in the city of Claremont just at the base of the San Gabriel mountains.\\u00a0 With its natural beauty and small-town feel, Claremont creates a perfect space for living and working.\\u00a0 It also provides easy access to all that Southern California has to offer, being located 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and less than 50 miles from Southern California beaches.\\n\\n**Our Commitment to Diversity:** CGU is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, national or ethnic origin, religion, ancestry, sex, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, marital status, or any other basis protected by applicable laws in its employment or hiring practices.\\u00a0 CGU is committed to increasing the diversity of the campus community and the curriculum.

Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management (the Drucker School) at Claremont Graduate University (CGU) invites qualified applicants for a tenure-track position in Marketing. We will consider candidates at the rank of Senior Assistant, Associate or Full Professor.\\n\\n**Qualifications:**\\u00a0 An earned Ph.D. in marketing or closely aligned field from a nationally or internationally recognized university is required. We will not consider ABD applicants. Qualified candidates must have a demonstrated record of research published in the field\\u2019s best journals. Building on the Drucker School\\u2019s focus on the role of the customer, the preferred candidate must have demonstrated excellence in research related to customers.

This interest can take a variety of forms including teaching, research, and service activities.\\n\\n**The Drucker School:** The Drucker School is one of five schools within CGU and is named after Peter F. Drucker (who served as a faculty member here for over forty years), widely considered the most influential thinker on management of our time. Grounded in a liberal arts tradition, the school is small, interdisciplinary, and composed a single faculty. The Drucker School stands out among business schools with its unique focus on management as fundamental to human achievement and its grounding in the works of Peter Drucker. We embrace Drucker\\u2019s core belief that responsible management is the backbone of a functioning society. Further, we believe that firms and managers must prioritize human thriving in their organizations and focus on both purpose and performance\\u2014ideas that are more important now than ever. Our class sizes are small and, as a result, the classroom is a more personalized experience. \\u00a0More details about our school, its vision, mission, and goals can be found in our most recent strategic plan ([https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/about/strategic-plan/](https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/about/strategic-plan/)).\\n\\n**About CGU and Claremont:** CGU is an independent liberal arts institution devoted entirely to graduate study. CGU is a member of The Claremont Colleges, a highly regarded cluster of seven independent colleges that is nationally and internationally renowned for academic excellence.\\u00a0 Given the transdisciplinary nature of graduate education at CGU, scholars whose research and teaching engages multiple fields and crosses disciplinary boundaries, and who are willing to mentor students beyond the areas of their own specialized research expertise, will find the Drucker School and the university a particularly satisfying intellectual home.\\u00a0 CGU and the Claremont Colleges are located in the city of Claremont just at the base of the San Gabriel mountains.\\u00a0 With its natural beauty and small-town feel, Claremont creates a perfect space for living and working.\\u00a0 It also provides easy access to all that Southern California has to offer, being located 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and less than 50 miles from Southern California beaches.\\n\\n**Our Commitment to Diversity:** CGU is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, national or ethnic origin, religion, ancestry, sex, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, marital status, or any other basis protected by applicable laws in its employment or hiring practices.\\u00a0 CGU is committed to increasing the diversity of the campus community and the curriculum.

Mason  \\n_Religion & Politics_, January 19, 2016\\n\\nOver the past century and a half, numerous authors, from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Jon Krakauer, have been fascinated\\u2014and horrified\\u2014by the nineteenth-century Mormon teaching of \\u201cblood atonement.\\u201d Particularly during the Mormon Reformation of 1856-57, in which leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sought to curtail apparent backsliding and inspire repentance through the use of forceful, often violent, preaching, Brigham Young and others taught that some sins, such as murder, were so grievous that only the voluntary shedding of the sinner\\u2019s own blood could satisfy the eternal demands of justice and thus secure the possibility of salvation. Critics of Mormonism, then and now, have made much of this teaching\\u2014despite the fact that it was in fact never the consensus view of the church and, contrary to many colorful assertions, did not inspire a theocratic bloodbath in pioneer Utah. (Scholars have disagreed about the role of \\u201cblood atonement\\u201d in the horrific Mountain Meadows Massacre; I tend toward those who dismiss it as a significant motivating cause.) It seems that the vast majority of Mormons either understood their leaders\\u2019 overblown rhetoric about blood atonement to be just that, or they simply rejected it as bad theology\\u2026\\n\\nRead the full article at: http://religionandpolitics.org/2016/01/19/for-mormons-a-contested-legacy-on-capital-punishment/#sthash.KMTQLg9u.dpuf\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Patrick Mason article in Religion & Politics: Capital Punishment - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/patrick-mason-article-in-religion-politics-capital-punishment/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Skip to content](#page)\\n\\n*   [MyCGU](https://my.cgu.edu/)\\n*   [Apply Now](https://www.cgu.edu/apply)\\n\\n[](#header-search-form \\\"open search field\\\")[Toggle Menu](#)\\n\\nAssistant Clinical Professor of Community and Global Health,  \\nAssociate Director of the Master of Public Health (MPH) program,  \\nCo-director of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO)/MPH dual program\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 1: Portrait of Bree Hemingway](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MAR-Bree-Hemingway-230118-127-Web-600x600.jpg)\\n\\n*   **Email**  \\n    [bree.l.hemingway@cgu.edu](mailto:bree.l.hemingway@cgu.edu)\\n*   **Phone**  \\n    909-607-8235\\n*   **CV**  \\n    [Download (PDF)](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bree-Hemingway-CV-Aug-2022.pdf)\\n*   **Degrees**  \\n    PhD, Psychology, Claremont Graduate University  \\n    MPH, Health Education, Promotion and Evaluation, Claremont Graduate University  \\n    BA, History, University of California, Los Angeles\\n*   **Research Interests**Program evaluation, health disparities, and public health workforce development\\n    \\n\\nBree Hemingway (She/Her) is an assistant clinical professor in the School of Community & Global Health at Claremont Graduate University.

The video will be uploaded to the CGU servers soon. Stay tuned for updates to this post and future posts that will direct you to the streaming videos of this conference and other guest speakers._\\n\\nAs Catrina\\u2019s post on Monday demonstrates, Claremont Mormon Studies allows for a unique space where insiders and outsiders to the tradition mingle, exchange ideas, and learn from one another. \\u00a0Another one of the features of student life at Claremont Graduate University is that, due to the efforts of the Mormon Studies Council and the Hunter Chair, a stream of guest lecturers and conferences every year. We hope to highlight these events in this blog as they occur in order to analyze and discuss what top scholars are contributing to Mormon Studies.\\n\\nOn March 15 and 16, Claremont hosted a conference entitled \\u201cBeyond the Mormon Moment: Directions for Mormon Studies in the New Century.\\u201d The event was subtitled, however, \\u201cA Conference in Honor of the Career of Armand Mauss,\\u201d and as a consequence featured many homages to Armand and his distinguished career as a sociologist. To open the conference Patrick Mason reflected on the passing of the most recent Mormon Moment and on the nature of Mormon Studies. In the rest of this post, I will briefly discuss part of what Mason said about the nature and future of Mormon Studies interlaced with some personal musings about my journey through Mormon Studies.\\n\\nMason sees one of the roles of Mormon Studies as the \\u201ccounterweight to all the silliness that passes for news and public information.\\u201d Most of us have witnessed, either firsthand or in the media, misunderstandings of Mormonism, ranging from laughable to grievous. For instance, upon hearing that I studied Mormonism, one acquaintance of mine expounded his theory of how Brian David Mitchell (Elizabeth Smart\\u2019s notorious kidnapper and ex-Latter-day Saint) was simply recruiting plural wives for the fundamentalists in southern Utah. I was able to disabuse him of this notion and give some quick context. However, even despite our best efforts, this type of conversation happens over and over. Personal exchanges are helpful, but they do not fix the larger problem of public information. The presence and persistence of quality Mormon Studies scholarship will probably not quell many memetic Mormon myths, but the continued establishment of Mormon Studies programs will lead more media outlets to consult qualified experts. The visibility of the programs themselves is the most important part of this equation, but the importance of the outflow of Mormon Studies alumni, both insiders and outsiders, into the academy (and other jobs) is no less important.\\n\\nMason also hinted at the problems of insider Mormon myths, often as erroneous as the public information profiled above. Mason quoted Armand Mauss, saying that \\u201cthe policy of denying the priesthood to people of African ancestry was an unnecessary and completely avoidable burden on the fundamental mission of the Church.\\u201d As stated, this proposition will likely be debated and contextualized for years to come \\u2014 but at the very least, the exposure of \\u201cracist folk doctrine\\u201d that lies hidden in the lived reality of Mormonism benefits all the members of the Church. One of the benefits of Mormon Studies that I have personally experienced is this very type of autoethnographic reflection where I can contextualize myself as a Latter-day Saint and learn what really does (and often what ought not to) constitute my faith.\\n\\nContinuing, Mason argued that Mormon Studies must \\u201cretain and clearly articulate a lively sense of its own intrinsic worth.\\u201d What then is the \\u201cintrinsic worth\\u201d of Mormon Studies? Mason saw this worth stemming from research. Even though applied research helps me and others correct misinformation, Mason sees \\u201cpure research\\u201d as valuable in its own right. \\u00a0Quoting CGU\\u2019s President Deborah Freund, Mason stated that \\u201cThe research university is one of mankind\\u2019s greatest inventions.\\u201d The study of Mormonism, beyond correcting pernicious rumors inside and outside of Mormon circles, \\u201cilluminate\\\\[s\\\\] certain aspects of the human experience and offer\\\\[s\\\\] insights to all the big questions.\\u201d\\n\\nTo conclude, Mason addressed the electoral loss of presidential candidate Mitt Romney, positing that \\u201cIf Mormon Studies atrophies as a scholarly field because the media and public have turned their attention elsewhere, then it wasn\\u2019t much of a scholarly field to begin with.\\u201d My time at Claremont has shown me that Mormon Studies as a field is indeed vibrant, compelling, and important. Having been lucky enough to be a student of both of the current Chairs in Mormon Studies (at CGU and Utah State), I have reaped intellectual and personal benefits from Mormon Studies in the academy.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Mormon Studies as a Counterweight - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/mormon-studies-as-a-counterweight/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Cortus Koehler](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-cortus-koehler.jpg)Cortus Koehler and his wife Addie were grateful for many things, one of which was Cortus's Claremont Graduate University experience.

Rollfast would net $5 million annually from bicycle sales if it could penetrate the market. Last week a businessman from an Asian country contacted Rollfast management and assured them that he could \\u201csmooth the way\\u201d for the company to sell in his country for a \\u201cgrease\\u201d fee of $500,000. In the Asian country, bribing is a custom which has long been considered natural.\\n\\n### If you were responsible, would you pay the fee?\\n\\nResearchers David Fritsche and Helmut Becker have been posing this question to leaders for years, and the answer is not as straightforward as you might think.\\n\\nHistorically, there have been two main ways to look at this scenario, both of them focusing on the action or the behavior.\\n\\nOn the one hand, people taking the _deontological_ (or the Kantian) approach say that an action is considered as either moral or immoral based on whether it adheres to a rule or rules. Interestingly, proponents of this approach do not care about the outcome of an action at all. Viewed through this lens, the answer for the scenario would be not to pay the fee, because it is a bribe and illegal and against company policy. Therefore, even though bribing is accepted in the Asian country and will surely increase revenue to the company, to the deontologists, bribing is wrong in itself, so the only answer in this situation is \\u201cno!\\u201d.\\n\\nOn the other hand, people adhering to the _consequential_ (or the Utilitarian) approach say that the rightness or wrongness of an action is judged by the consequences of the action. Viewed through this lens, if paying the fee will surely lead to the increased revenue and no one is hurt in the process; then paying the bribe is not unethical. \\u00a0Since bribing is considered in the Asian country as a \\u201ccustom,\\u201d this will benefit both the company and the businessman requesting a bribe. And because bribing has been considered natural in this country for a long time, as long as the bribe provides a win-win situation to both parties, then, to the consequentialists, the answer in this situation is \\u201cyes!\\u201d\\n\\nIn addition to these two perspectives, there is a third ethical perspective that has been getting attention from leadership scholars recently: the _Aristotelian_ approach (or virtue-based ethics). Compared to deontological and consequential accounts that emphasize the nature or consequence of _an action_, proponents of the Aristotelian approach focus on the character of _the decision maker._ Viewed through this lens, the judgment of the action differs case by case. If the decision maker is considered to be a reliable and moral person and the decision is based on the decision maker\\u2019s own ethical guidelines (be they deontology, consequentialism, or another perspective), then the decision maker\\u2019s action becomes ethical regardless of whether he or she bribes or not. In contrast, if the decision maker is considered as unreliable and unethical, then neither path would be seen by the Aristotelians as ethical.\\n\\nAs described so far, the answer to what constitutes ethical leadership is dependent on what lens we wish to view it. So far, we have compared three different perspectives on business ethics and found that it is possible for a business decision to be justified as ethical from one perspective but unethical from another perspective. These contrasting views on business ethics make the nature of ethical leadership controversial among scholars.\\n\\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple perspectives on ethics does not mean that behaviors that are not supported by any of these theories can be seen as ethical. If, in the scenario, the decision maker were an immoral person and bribing would cause severe financial loss to any involved parties, then bribing could not be justified by any of the three ethics perspectives. From the deontological account, bribing itself is unethical. From the consequential account, incurring a financial loss is unacceptable. From the virtue ethics account, any decision made by an immoral person is unethical. Therefore, while acknowledging multiple perspectives on business ethics and ethical leadership, we should also be alert for an unethical or immoral behavior that cannot be justified by any of the three ethical perspectives.\\n\\n### About the Author\\n\\nShin Han (shin.han@cgu.edu) is a doctoral student in positive organizational psychology at Claremont Graduate University.

Her research interests lie in the broad areas of diversity, prejudice, and stereotyping\\u2014specifically, understanding the contextual factors that create and reinforce social disparities such as the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\\n\\nWoodcock studied at Macquarie University in Australia and received her PhD in social psychology from Purdue University. She now conducts longitudinal research and evaluation of large-scale interventions for broadening participation in STEM, and in issues of diversity and inclusion more generally. Her research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Education, and she maintains active collaborations with the Endocrine Society and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). Through this work, she answers empirical questions about the short and longer-term impact of negative stereotypes on identity and identity balance. One example explores an intervention with the parents of Latinx incoming college STEM majors to significantly increase students\\u2019 academic performance and decrease their likelihood of leaving their STEM major. Research then compares the impact of how White and Latinx STEM students balance their racial/ethnic and science identities over time.\\n\\nWoodcock attributes a share of the success of these large-scale longitudinal research programs to the tailored panel management (TPM) protocol she developed and has used for the past decade to maximize participant commitment and participation in research. She has mentored and trained more than 100 students on her research projects, and collaborates with investigators and their students across many institutions. \\u00a0She infuses her research into her teaching, with courses in social psychology, the psychology of prejudice, and statistics. Woodcock is also a research scientist and affiliated principal investigator at California State University San Marcos, where she teaches and works with students.\\n\\n*   [Selected Works](#)\\n*   [Classes](#)\\n\\nHernandez, P.R., Woodcock, A, Estrada, M, & Schultz, P.W.

You qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction when you itemize on your taxes. If you continue to pay premiums on the policy, each payment is tax deductible as a charitable gift when you itemize.\\n\\n**Make an outright gift of a new policy.** You can take out a new policy and irrevocably name CGU as the owner and the beneficiary of the insurance contract.

Advancing your career may feel challenging on its own, but it can become increasingly difficult to excel in your career with a busy personal and family life. This article gives a few practical implications to helping women in this modern era advance in their careers, and advice on achieving some sort of balance between work and family.\\n\\nEmpowering Yourself\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn a research study conducted in 2001 by Gomez et. al., it was shown that women who became successful in the workplace had worked on their self-confidence. When you do not feel like your voice is being heard, remember that your opinions count. Reframing struggles and challenges in the workplace as growth opportunities can also help your mindset. Obstacles will always occur, but how one perceives the situation can be the difference between seeing a challenge as an opportunity for growth versus a tormenting hurdle.\\n\\nLeader Development Opportunities\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nLeader development opportunities can also help with one\\u2019s leadership skills and career advancement. Leader development opportunities include formal training, receiving 360-degree feedback, coaching, mentoring, and self-learning. Learning when to negotiate and self-promote may also help with empowering yourself and advancing your career in the workplace. Even though you may have a mentor, having a sponsor vouch for your career will take you one step closer to reaching for the promotion you deserve (Carter & Silva, 2010). The use and expanding of social support networks also has been shown to help women develop professionally and advance their opportunities for career growth.\\n\\nFocusing on a Participative, Relational Leadership Style\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nResearch by Eagly & Carli (2006) has shown that women generally have a more democratic, participative, and collaborator style of leading. A study by Stern (2008) revealed that high-achieving women tend to adopt this kind of relational leadership style. The women in the study also possessed a strong sense of conviction and self-worth. Femininity and leadership are no longer considered separate constructs and do not need to be! Being serious about your work while being considerate and respectful of your staff and colleagues can help condone this effective type of relational leadership to others. Encouraging colleagues to do their best and share their ideas evoke a participative environment. Your greater willingness to share information with others can also drive better performance results through the company.\\n\\nIntegrating Work-Family Balance\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nHalpern & Cheung (2008) found certain effective strategies in balancing work and personal lives from women leaders. Findings from the study included multitasking, being clear about your goals to your company and in your household, and recognizing that you do not have to \\u2018do it all\\u2019. By multitasking, you can create links between family and work. For example, you can try to work from home when possible or be present for family events. By being succinct about your goals to yourself and others, you can make day-to-day decisions that are based on both your family and work needs. Relieving yourself from the pressure society may place on you to excel in your career while also being a super mom may also be beneficial. Recognizing to let go of certain tasks that are not a priority and outsourcing work in a busy office may help with integrating balance between work and family. Acquiring additional household help was also found to be helpful for the busy working mothers.\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nThe tips and suggestions above are accumulated through research findings and lessons learned from women who have found success in their careers. Focusing on advancing your career through development opportunities, adopting a participative leadership style, and integrating techniques to help balance your work and family life may all help with advancing your career. Knowing when to reach for that promotion and acquiring sponsorship and networking opportunities can set the stage for further professional and career development. Integrating family and office roles as being compatible with one another will help with one\\u2019s mindset in achieving balance between family and work.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n_[Emily Chan](http://www.leadlabs.org/about-lead/lead-team-members-2/emily-chan/) is a Ph.D. student in Organizational Behavior at Claremont Graduate University.

I wanted to be in a collaborative learning environment primarily because I am transitioning from the education industry and I don't have a business background.\\n\\nWhen I first learned about the principle on which the school was built, \\\"Management is... a liberal art\\\", I knew that this school is where I wanted to be because my academic background would not be seen as a disadvantage when compared to my peers, but as one of the branches of Knowledge on which management is built, which I can use to add value to classroom discussions and group assignments.\\n\\n**How has the program benefited you so far?**  \\nThus far, the program has exposed me to a wide range of issues affecting various industries and to the different cultures that exist within organizations, through the analysis of case studies and with firsthand observation respectively\\n\\n**Describe your experience in the classroom and the caliber of the professors.**  \\nThe professors here believe in the Drucker philosophy and teach that with utmost passion. Irrespective of the difference in teaching styles, professors at Drucker have one thing in common- they all encourage analytical thought. This is one aspect of the classroom experience that I have come to appreciate because everyone is given the opportunity to engage. Additionally, smaller classes and personalized attention at Drucker engenders an atmosphere that enhances the learning experience.\\n\\n**What are your career goals?**  \\nCurrently I am at a crossroads in terms of my actual career goals, but one thing I am certain of is that I enjoy working with people and I am committed to community service. I want to be in a role where I can combine the two.\\n\\n**How will your Drucker degree help you further your career?**  \\nI believe that the program will continue to expose me to different concepts and theories about management, but most importantly it is teaching me how to manage myself. I believe that self-management is an integral part of one's development and if I am cognizant of my own strengths and weakness then I will be in a better position to help and manage other people.\\n\\n**What has been your most memorable experience at the Drucker School?**  \\nTo date, my most memorable experience at the Drucker School is winning a (group) case study competition at the end of a three-day orientation seminar. All four members of my group were presented with a Kindle. To me, this symbolized a good start to the academic year.\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

However Charles Eames[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1) offered the following: \\u201cA plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose\\u201d. Others say that _design_ refers to the application of synthetic and analytic process to plan and create new objects. Design is often thought of in the context of creativity or invention. Design research can indeed result in the production of beautiful, useful, and better artifacts. _Design research_ is distinctly different from _explanation research._\\u00a0 The goal of explanation research is to _discover_, understand, and explain phenomena associated with natural phenomenon or information systems.\\u00a0 Explanation research methods and traditions are based on _natural science_.\\u00a0 The goal of design research, on the other hand, is to _invent_ methods and processes for designing and developing effective and efficient information systems.\\u00a0 The methods and traditions of design research are based on _design science_ and _sciences of the artificial_ (Herbert A. Simon, _Sciences of the Artificial_, third edition, MIT Press, 1996). Design research paradigm is fundamentally a problem solving paradigm.\\n\\nThe course begins with a fundamental discussion on what is research and the process behind being a successful researcher. Then a number of distinct research methods used in Information Systems is introduced. Design Science research paradigm is then discussed. A framework is presented in detail that helps students grasp the big picture in IS design research. Several exemplar design papers from journals and conferences are discussed and analyzed. There are a number of well-known design companies that exists around the world. We review the methodology that is followed by these companies as they design useful objects for everyday use.\\n\\nThe course develops skills for implementing and evaluating the techniques and methods that are used in the various phases of design research.\\u00a0 After an exposure to the characteristics that differentiate design research from other types of research, research methods and techniques used in the various phases of such research will be discussed in the context of exemplars of such research.\\u00a0 Common methods that are used in both the important phases of design research namely, building and evaluation will be covered. Managing design projects for commercial clients and their issues are also discussed. The exemplars will be from a number of information systems areas such as software engineering, networking, Internet technologies, information security, telemedicine, database, e-commerce, wireless information systems and others. Students will work on their own design research proposal.\\n\\nProf. Chatterjee founded the International Conference on Design Science Research in IS&T (aka DESRIST). CGU and CISAT research is now well known in this field. Please check ([http://desrist2013.fi/](http://desrist2013.fi/)) for more information on DESRIST 2013. DESRIST was started in Claremont (2006), and later were held in Pasadena (2007), Atlanta (2008), Philadelphia (2009), St. Gallen, Switzerland, 2010, Milwaukee (2011), Las Vegas (2012) and Helsinki Finland (2013).\\n\\n**Learning Objectives:**\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the course, students will be able to:\\n\\n1.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Describe the essential characteristics of design research and to differentiate it from other types of research;\\n\\n2.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Discuss in oral and written form the key ideas and intellectual currents underlying design research and its methods;\\n\\n3.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Present a well-developed argument, in written and oral forms, for the importance of a selected research topic within the theme of the course and articulate a proposal for conducting research on the topic.\\n\\n4.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Conduct design research and write a paper that, with refinement, could be submitted to a conference.\\n\\n5.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Be well-versed with the three basic elements of contemporary design projects: use of formal design methods, management of small projects with hard deadlines, and aspects of group dynamics.\\n\\n**Method of Instruction and Grading:**\\n\\nThe course will be conducted as a doctoral seminar.

The proposal must have an introduction, description of the problem, research issues and/or questions, the approach to be followed in conducting the research, the methodology to be used and its appropriateness, and the expected significance of the research. You must also do a literature review in the context of the problem and its importance for the proposal.\\n\\n**Final Research Paper**: (Individual)\\n\\n_Phase 1: Problem Definition project_\\n\\nEach student will choose a particular topic (domain) of his/her interest. The problem should be stated as well as described. Keep in mind that the problem should have scale and scope so that you remain interested in it for the entire semester as well as later work on for a possible dissertation. Then s/he will develop an actual design science research paper around this problem.\\n\\n_Phase 2: Background Literature review_\\n\\nThe student is expected to read at least 12 to 15 (possibly more) journal and conference articles that are related to the topic so that s/he can begin to formulate his/her own unique solution.\\n\\n_Phase 3: Final Research paper presentation and submission_\\n\\nThis paper should be suitable for submission to a conference such as WITS, HICSS, DESRIST or any suitable IEEE/ACM/AIS venues. The student will also make an oral presentation of this research paper. The student needs to argue why the proposed research is important, and why there is reason to believe that the research will be successfully completed. Note that several students who have taken his course in the past have published papers in conferences such as HICSS and Trudi Miller\\u2019s paper received the best paper award at HICSS 2007.\\n\\n**Exemplar papers presentation & critique**\\n\\nEach student will choose or will be assigned a paper in class to present every week. The papers will be mainly chosen from the list provided in the syllabus or it can also be from any other relevant sources. The idea is to read the paper, absorb the material and critique the paper in terms of its merits and drawbacks. Throughout the critique, special attention is to be given to design research principles.\\n\\n**Texts:**\\n\\nAlan Hevner and Samir Chatterjee. **_Design Research in Information Systems: Theory & Practice_**.

Students are expected to provide their experiences either at work, prior job and somewhere else that relates to topics being discussed.\\n\\nBoth the quantity of comments (i.e. how many times a student speaks) and, more importantly, the quality of the comments will be taken into account. The quality of your comments will be evaluated using the following criteria:\\n\\n*   Does the comment represent a solid analysis of facts or just a reiteration of what was said?\\n*   Does the comment address the question currently on the floor, or is it way off the mark?\\n*   Does the comment demonstrate an ability to listen to and build from what others have said?\\n*   Is the point made concisely, or is it buried in a long, rambling, diatribe?\\n*   Does the comment move the discussion to an important area or does it just rephrase what has already been said?\\n\\n**Instructors Policy:**\\n\\nStudents are expected to attend all classes (and to arrive on time!), except when precluded by emergencies, religious holidays or other extenuating circumstances. If you will be absent from class for any reason, please notify the instructor in advance whenever possible. If you have an unusual situation that will affect your class attendance, please discuss this with me. All students are expected to be prepared to discuss each exemplar research paper and also critique the presentations of others. In assigning grades, both your class attendance and your contribution during class discussions will be taken into consideration. I will be keeping tabs on how active you are in case discussions and other discussions throughout the semester.\\n\\n**Policy on Plagiarism:**\\n\\nIt is understood that each student is subject to rules related to academic honesty. In no case is plagiarism accepted in academic endeavors. If you use someone else\\u2019s work, you must provide a citation about that use, whether it comes from a published paper, an unpublished paper or assignment, or any other source. Failure to meet this ethical standard will result in disciplinary action, which can range from receiving a failing grade on an assignment, to automatic failure of the class, to a withdrawal from your academic program.\\n\\nWelcome to the Course!\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Eames, Charles and Ray.

Her father had converted as a child, and her mother\\u2019s family had joined the church after World War II, drawn initially to the Church by the free English classes it was offering. Beatta finished high school, spent a year working in England, and then decided to attend BYU. She credits the Church with enabling her migration to the United States, since she would not have been able to afford tuition at other US universities.\\n\\n![Image 2: Beatta Bosworth](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2019/11/beatta-e1573855063707-951x1024.jpg)\\n\\nWhile at BYU, Beatta met and married a man who had served his mission in Finland. She became the president of Relief Society in her student ward in Logan, Utah, and finished her degree in fine arts photography at Utah State University. She and her husband moved to Irvine, CA where they are raising three children. Beatta now works as a photographer and manages the household.Beatta sees some differences in how the religion is experienced and practiced in Finland and in the US. She says that the Church in Finland is so small, but it\\u2019s filled with people who are loyal and dedicated. It\\u2019s hard to convince Finns to join, but once they decide to, they tend to be strong and stay with the Church. Also, she points to cultural differences, particularly regarding gender. In Finnish society, there tends to be more equality for men and women, and that was reflected in her experience at church. The  \\nChurch-sponsored Scout program included both boys and girls, and she felt like the Relief Society and Young Women presidents in her ward were seen and treated as part of the ward leadership with decision-making power. She also sees a difference in discourse around modesty. Because of Finnish sauna culture, nakedness is not necessarily sexualized, and when modesty discourse did arise at church in Finland, it tended to be more expansive and to focus on the whole self rather than only being about clothing.Beatta says that she is liking the direction that the church is taking now\\u2014getting back to basics, focusing on Christ and his teachings, and talking less about how to live life day to day. She says, \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s best looks so different.

As a child and youth she was drawn to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because of the architecture of its buildings and the friendliness of its members. She joined the church as a teenager after her older sister became a member. She later served a mission, a difficult decision because of her mother\\u2019s opposition. Marriage to another Latter-day Saint brought her to Ibadan, Nigeria. She and her husband have one young child.\\n\\nWhile being a Latter-day Saint woman can be challenging in Nigeria, Ekikere feels that one rewarding aspect is the strong sense of family that the church promotes. She also feels a strong connection to the plan of salvation. Initially, it was hard for Ekikere to connect to the Book of Mormon, but after dreaming of Jesus handing the Book of Mormon to her, that scripture has become an important part of her faith.\\n\\nEkikere recounts that membership in the church has opened up opportunities for her. Serving a mission taught her important social skills, and she has participated in the BYU Pathway program, taking classes online. She also appreciates Relief Society classes that have taught practical skills, like making bread and soap. Her only real regret is not finding the church earlier in her life. If she had, she feels like she would have had more direction educationally and professionally.\\n\\nRead or listen to [Ekikere Ayodele\\u2019s full oral history](https://ccdl.claremont.edu/digital/collection/cms/id/370/rec/18).\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Ekikere Nelson Ayodele - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/ayodele/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: a statue of a woman holding a child](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/03/Cyprian-Sandstone-Figurine.jpeg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/03/Cyprian-Sandstone-Figurine.jpeg)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:**  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):** Figurine, Jewelry  \\n**Object Material(s):** soapstone, stone  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Cyprus  \\n**Provenience Location:** Cyprus  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\n9 Cyprian figurines and pendants\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 1974  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 1976  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Action by Respondent's Govt.\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Christakis Hadjiprodromou  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Cyprus  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Private: Individual\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Christie's (London)  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United Kingdom  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Private: Company\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\\n\\nMichael Jansen, War and Cultural Heritage: Cyprus after the 1974 Turkish Invasion (Univ.

Talking to the Associated Press Patrick Mason, Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California discussed the essay on women and the priesthood, which declared that neither Joseph Smith nor any other church leader ordained women. Mason noted, \\u201cThe article can be taken as a rebuttal to pieces published by historians, feminists and theologians who argue Smith did, in fact, bestow priesthood on women since 1843, and that modern church leaders are incorrectly withholding this privilege from women.\\u201d  \\nFor the full article, please visit:  \\n[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9d6b5fb4c22240d0963c9f33e0e809fb/mormon-essay-address-history-women-priesthood](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9d6b5fb4c22240d0963c9f33e0e809fb/mormon-essay-address-history-women-priesthood)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Patrick Mason in Big Story re: Women & Priesthood Essays - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/patrick-mason-in-big-story-re-women-priesthood-essays/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### With a PhD in Mathematics from Claremont Graduate University, you will join a community of highly educated, capable scientists\\u00a0who excel at communicating knowledge to students, fellow mathematicians, and the global community.\\n\\n[![Image 1: us news & world report's best grad schools in mathematics](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Grad_Mathematics.jpg)](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/mathematics-rankings)CGU\\u2019s Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMS) trains scientists in fundamental areas of mathematics and develops expertise in specialized areas of interest.

These units must include one\\u00a0[transdisciplinary course](https://www.cgu.edu/why-cgu/transdisciplinary-studies/courses/), per University policy.\\n\\nStudents must fulfill the CGU residency requirement: at least two semesters of full-time study within a two-year period or 48 units within a three-year period. It is recommended that coursework be completed on a full-time basis; while part-time attendance is an option, degree requirements should be fulfilled within a seven-year time frame.\\n\\nStudents who do not maintain a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 in Mathematics courses are placed on academic probation. Students who remain on academic probation after taking an additional 8 units of Mathematics courses may be excluded from the program.\\n\\nStudents are assigned an academic advisor upon entering the program. As they reach the advanced stages of coursework, they select a research advisor, who assumes primary advising responsibilities. In order to advance to candidacy, students must select a PhD committee consisting of at least three Mathematics faculty members from within the Claremont Colleges, chaired by the research advisor.\\n\\n**Research Tools**  \\nThe following two research tools, intended to help prepare students for independent research, are required:\\n\\n*   1\\\\. Research seminar requirement. Over a period of at least two semesters, each student must attend a mathematics research seminar regularly. This may be a CCMS research seminar, mathematics colloquium, faculty-organized topical seminar, or student-organized journal club. The student must submit to his or her advisor a list of seminar talks attended, as well as written summaries of three seminar talks. Each summary, of about 1-2 pages in length, should outline the basic problem, the methods used, and the results. Completion of this research tool is required within one year of passing the written qualifying exam.\\n*   2\\\\. Proficiency requirement. Each student must demonstrate proficiency in one of the following two categories. Completion of this research tool is required before advancing to candidacy.\\n    *   Computational: A computer programming language, statistical research method, or other computational research tool approved by the advisor.\\n    *   Foreign language: French, German, or Russian.\\n\\n**Qualifying Examination**  \\nThe written qualifying examination is given once per year, at the end of the Spring semester. Full-time students in the Mathematics PhD program take the exam immediately following the first year of coursework. Part-time students may wait until they have completed 16 units of CGU coursework. Students failing the exam on the first attempt must repeat the exam the following year. Failure to pass the exam on the second attempt results in dismissal from the program.\\n\\nStudents dismissed from the doctoral program in Mathematics for failure to pass the exam may, at the discretion of the faculty, qualify for a terminal master\\u2019s degree. However, they may not transfer to another doctoral program offered through the Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\\n\\n**Preliminary Examinations**  \\nStudents are required to pass two preliminary examinations, within two years of passing the written qualifying exam, but no later than 3 months after the completion of 72 units of coursework. Unless there are mitigating circumstances, failure to complete the exams within the specified period is cause for dismissal from the program.\\n\\n**Advancement to Candidacy**  \\nAfter completing the qualifying and preliminary examinations, doctoral students must prepare a written dissertation proposal. In the advancement to candidacy examination, the student presents the proposed dissertation research.

Beginning in the early 1950s, Nigerian independent Christian groups began to solicit Latter-day Saint church missionaries, materials, and official integration into the American Latter-day Saint ecclesiastical network. The most widely known among them is Anthony Obinna, a school teacher in the Mbaise village network. After experiencing a series of visions and establishing contact with LDS church officials, he began to hold independent meetings with his family. This film will situate the Obinnas\\u2014and Nigerian Latter-day Saints, writ large\\u2014at the center of their narrative, liberated from the bounds placed upon them by American Latter-day Saint popular mythology.\\n\\n**Amy Hoyt, \\u201cWomen, Religion and Transitional Justice in Africa: LDS, Catholic and Muslim Women\\u201d**\\n\\nThis project aims to examine transitional justice in South Africa and Rwanda through the lens of gender and religion, specifically comparing Latter-day Saint, Catholic and Muslim women\\u2019s experiences with forgiveness and reconciliation after national conflict. The Truth and Reconciliation Committee in South Africa and the gacaca courts in Rwanda have used reconciliation models, or transitional justice, in order to attempt to heal the collective psyches of their nations. The literature is rich with comparisons between these two models, yet research is lacking in analyzing women\\u2019s experience within these models, and there is no research to date that examines how women\\u2019s religious beliefs affect them within these reconciliation models. This project set out to answer two general questions: what are women\\u2019s experiences within transitional justice models? Does religious belief change women\\u2019s experience of transitional justice? This project makes an impact on the wider field of women and religion and contributes to the literature on gender and peace studies.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Melissa Wei-Tsing Inouye and Laurie Maffly-Kipp, \\u201cGlobal Mormonism: Theory and Case Studies from East Asia\\u201d**\\n\\nThis book project uses a combination of broad theoretical analysis and focused case studies and to break new ground in research on Mormonism as a global religious phenomenon. Asia, the home of the vast majority of the world\\u2019s people, has been perceived as the most enticing prospect for Protestant evangelization since the nineteenth century. Today, the church\\u2019s regional headquarters and temple in its \\u201cAsia Area\\u201d have been established in Hong Kong, but the project of cultivating local Mormon communities in the region remains highly variegated, challenging, and dynamic.\\u00a0 The cutting-edge research in this volume examines the homogenizing and heterogenizing processes unfolding simultaneously within Mormonism\\u2019s centralized bureaucracy and local congregations.\\n\\n**Melanie Riwai-Couch, \\u201cThe Influence of Membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Young People Aged 14-18 in Aotearoa, New Zealand\\u201d**\\n\\nPresented as a series of case studies, this research considers the impact of attending early morning seminary, mid-week mutual activities and Sunday services on LDS young people\\u2019s attitudes towards schooling, family relationships, future career, and aspirations.\\u00a0 The case studies also include youth perspectives about self-esteem, identity, gender-roles, sexuality, and leadership. Interviewed youth identify as Maori, New Zealand European, New Zealand born Pacific Islander, and immigrants to New Zealand. This research provides a qualitative measure of the positive and negative impacts of church participation and membership on young people during their formative years.\\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**John P. Bartkowski, \\u201cThe Sinner, the Saint, and the Making of Hawaiian Mormonism**\\u201d\\n\\nThis project generates a comparative portrait of two iconic figures in Mormon Hawaiian history. Walter Murray Gibson (1822-1888) emigrated to Hawaii from the mainland U.S. and founded a Latter-day Saint community on the island of Lanai. He was later excommunicated from the LDS Church for various misdeeds, but he continued to exercise immense political influence. Hamana Kalili (1882-1958) was a native Hawaiian and devout Mormon from the small LDS town of L\\u0101\\u2019ie on the Island of Oahu. Kalili is celebrated for his community service, hard work, and the shaka (hang loose) hand sign famous throughout Hawaii. This study uses insights from interpretive biography to examine the sharp contrasts between the respective arcs of these two men\\u2019s lives and collective memory to analyze how each has been subsequently characterized by Latter-day Saints. The rival archetypes of Gibson as a migrant Hawaiian sinner and Kalili as a native Hawaiian saint advances current understandings of Polynesian and global Mormonism.\\n\\n**Brittany Romanello, \\u201cUndocumented Latina Mothers\\u2019 Social and Parenting Experiences in Mormonism\\u201d**\\n\\nThis project evaluates how gender, ethnicity, and undocumented motherhood exist together in the Mormon faith. Romanello interviewed about thirty undocumented Latina LDS mothers about their parenting and social experiences in pan ethnic, Spanish, or Portuguese speaking Latinx congregations. Respondents were recruited from California, Utah, and Nevada. Using gender theory, this project explores how these Latina LDS mothers conceptualize belonging while navigating intersectional societal disadvantage.\\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Ryan A. Davis, \\u201c_Los Mormones_ in Spain: Popular Literature and Public Opinion\\u201d**\\n\\nThis project focuses on representations of Mormonism in popular literature and the public sphere (periodicals and television) in twentieth century Spain. Through textual analysis, Davis identifies the themes, plots, and characterization of Mormonism in Spanish novels, situating them in relation to both Spanish popular literature from the twentieth century and representations of Mormonism in other national literatures. This project is the first of its kind to study representations of Mormonism in Spanish literature and promises to enrich understanding of the emerging story of global Mormonism.\\n\\n**Spencer P. Greenhalgh, \\u201cEvery Nation, Kindred, Tongue, and \\u201cTweeple\\u201d: International Use of the #ldsconf and #twitterstake Twitter Hashtags\\u201d**\\n\\nBoth Mormonism and the Internet are worldwide phenomena, but the existing scholarly work on \\u201cMormon Twitter\\u201d has implicitly focused on English-language activity concentrated in the United States. The aim of this study is to describe the international use of two Twitter hashtags associated with LDS General Conference: #ldsconf and #twitterstake. In particular, Greenhalgh answers the following research questions about these hashtags: How much participation comes from outside the United States? Which countries (other than the United States) are most represented? Which languages are most represented in international participation? What Mormon identities are expressed by international participants? An explicit focus on international participants promises to lend further insight into the diversity of identity present in these spaces\\u2014both in terms of how orthodox Mormonism is translated into other cultures and how members of other cultures push back on what is accepted as orthodox Mormonism.\\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Alison Halford, \\u201cFrom Mormonism to the \\u2018Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ?\\u2019 Navigating American Exceptionalism and Regional Practices in a Global Religion\\u201d**\\n\\nThis project explores how European Mormon women differentiate between American culture and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in order to understand what \\u201cgospel culture\\u201d means to congregations outside of North America. In studying the negotiations of Greek, Swedish, and English Latter-day Saint women, we can identify the scale of mobilization against Americanized forms of worship, ideals, and practices to generate a gospel culture. This will generate a body of work that shows to what extent European women are reproducing a gospel culture that is informed by regional practices and raises question on the role piety has in resisting Utah imperialism.\\n\\n**Holly Miller Jones, \\u201cRegional Interpretation of Gender by Temple Patrons of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\u201d**\\n\\nUntil the recent changes, the temple endowment ritual of the LDS church, arguably the most central and significant ritual for church members, included several ritualized differences based on gender. Some patrons view these gendered differences in a positive light, but other patrons view these differences with ambiguity or negatively, finding ways to reconcile these meanings with their loyalty to the church and understanding of God. This study aims to determine how women in Fiji, a country which ranks high on the Gender Inequality Index, understand the recent changes and the past and present gendered differences in the temple ceremony compared to European-descended women in New Zealand, a country which ranks relatively low in the Gender Inequality Index.\\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Jason Palmer, \\u201cSacred Places Between Holy Cities: Mormon Migration Across Peru and Utah\\u201d**\\n\\nThis project explores how the incursion of Mormonism into Latin America creates regimes of power involved in global migration and exclusivity, which stand as the driving force behind a freshly viewed spiritual geography with its own holy regimes of solidarity that Mormons enact in everyday sacred place-making. For Peruvian Mormons today, this spiritual geography expresses a contradiction between the ideal of a universal Mormon identity and the reality of Peruvian Mormon existence inside a hierarchical topography of sacred places seen as geographically, genealogically, and spiritually unequal. This contradiction comes to the fore as Peruvian Mormons immigrate to their church\\u2019s historic \\u201ccore\\u201d in Utah or decide to stay and build sacred place, what they call Zion, in its Peruvian \\u201cperiphery.\\u201d In following a growing community of these Mormons in Arequipa, Peru for seven months and their kin in Utah for ten, Palmer explores how Mormons come to belong in both a global collective and a specific place.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Award Winners - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/projects/global/global-mormonism-oral-history-project/award-winners/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"LeAD Certified Coaches\\n----------------------\\n\\nLeAD Certified Coaches undergo a rigorous selection process and receive extensive feedback on key coaching behaviors to ensure they are equipped with strong interpersonal and coaching skills.

Third parties wishing to enroll in the mass notification system may contact the Human Resources office to update or add contact information at 909-607-4404.\\n\\nIndividuals responsible for issuing the emergency notification (usually the Campus Safety communications officers and supervisors) will, with the assistance of campus and local first responders, determine the content of the notification. Those issuing the notification will use the following guidelines when determining the contents of the emergency notification:\\n\\nThe first message is intended to alert the community (or appropriate segment of the Claremont Colleges community) of the emergency and the actions they should take to safeguard their and their neighbor\\u2019s safety. Messages distributed in this stage of a rapidly unfolding incident will generally be short, precise, and directive.\\n\\nThe second message is intended to inform the community (or appropriate segment of the Claremont Colleges community) about additional details of the situation. This message is generally distributed once first responders and the Emergency Operations Center has additional information about the dangerous situation.\\n\\nFinally, the third message is the reassure notice that is generally distributed once the situation is nearly or completely resolved. The purpose of this message is to reassure the Claremont Colleges community that the Claremont Colleges or CGU is working diligently to resolve the dangerous situation. It can also be used to provide additional information about the situation and where resources will be available.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Home - CGU Emergency Information\", \"source\": \"http://info.cgu.edu/emergency\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### The highly customizable master\\u2019s degree in mathematics provides the essential training and skills in pure or applied math\\u00a0to compete for positions in education, industry, and government laboratories.\\n\\n[![Image 1: us news & world report's best grad schools in mathematics](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Grad_Mathematics.jpg)](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/mathematics-rankings)The master\\u2019s program in mathematics allows you to customize your coursework as you develop mastery in one or more areas of pure or applied math.

Hunter became the 14th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on June 5, 1994, at age 86. Despite ill health, he maintained a busy schedule with extensive traveling and speaking. Only nine months later, on March 3, 1995, President Hunter\\u2019s earthly ministry came to an end.\\n\\nDuring his years of service President Hunter emphasized the common humanity of all the children of God, and encouraged greater attention to the love of God and fellow humans:\\n\\n\\u201cAll men are invited to come unto \\\\[God\\\\] and all are alike unto him. Race makes no difference; color makes no difference; nationality makes no difference. The brotherhood of man is literal. We are all of one blood and the literal spirit offspring of our eternal Heavenly Father. Before we came to earth, we belonged to his eternal family. We associated and knew each other there. Our common paternity makes us not only literal sons and daughters of eternal parentage, but literal brothers and sisters as well. This is a fundamental teaching of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\u201d (Howard W. Hunter, \\u201cAll Are Alike Unto God,\\u201d Address at Brigham Young University, 4 February 1979)\\n\\nWe have an exciting opportunity both to honor President Howard W.

This program will enable generations of students to learn about one of the world\\u2019s most dynamic religions and to help bring greater academic and public understanding of Mormonism.\\n\\nThe Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies was the first such position outside the state of Utah, and the first graduate-level program of its kind in the world.

While it is essential to study and address such pathologies, it is equally important to understand those aspects of human experience that make life worth living. The center conducts research on such issues, and provides a forum for scholars from the U.S. and abroad who wish to extend their studies in positive psychology.\\n\\nGraduate programs in positive psychology were launched in the fall of 2007 through the School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation, Division of Behavioral and Organizational Sciences and Department of Psychology. The PhD programs in Positive Organizational Psychology and Positive Developmental Psychology provide research training in positive psychology. MA co-concentrations in Evaluation and either Positive Organizational Psychology or Positive Developmental Psychology are also offered.\\n\\n### Research\\n\\nThe center is currently conducting research projects on the sources of good mentoring with a grant from the Spencer Foundation, and on well-being as part of the cross-national Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation. Other research the center is currently pursuing include the study of everyday life using experience sampling methods and the study of good work in the second half of life.\\n\\nWith the help of grants from the Fetzer, Ford, Hewlett, Spencer, and Templeton Foundations, the center has conducted research jointly with Harvard and Stanford universities on the conditions that make good work in the professions possible. Areas investigated included business, human genetics, the media, philanthropy, and higher education. Findings are used to enhance professional training in these areas.\\n\\nThe center welcomes inquiries about collaboration on projects in line with its basic mission.\\n\\nIf you are interested in being a participant in studies conducted by the Center, please email us at [qlrc.research@cgu.edu](mailto:qlrc.research@cgu.edu).\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Quality of Life Research Center\", \"source\": \"http://www.cgu.edu/qlrc\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Andy Johnson](https://research.cgu.edu/pacific-rim-tobacco-and-alcohol-use-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/11/Johnson4a.jpg)  \\n[**C.

We believe that no two artists are the same, so we strive to provide you with the space to experiment freely\\u2014with whatever media, approach, and goals you choose. We challenge all artists in our program to test what they have done against the views of those who make up our artistic community, which serves as a support structure as our graduates take their work out into the world, where it tells stories, broadens understanding, shapes perspectives, and makes a difference.\\n\\nOur [two-year MFA program](https://www.cgu.edu/academics/program/mfa/) allows you to create your own customized course of study that includes one-on-one meetings with internationally recognized faculty as well as seminars, tutorials, critiques, and workshops. What you do as an artist is at the core of our program.

Results from 1999 to 2004 indicate that individual disposition and cultural context have a potentially important moderator effect on prevention programs. In this project, we hypothesize that genetic factors responsible for dispositional attributes, such as hostility and depression, act to both influence an individual\\u2019s smoking behavior and to moderate the effectiveness of tobacco control intervention and prevention trials.\\n\\nTo this end, we will conduct a genetic epidemiologic study of genetic polymorphisms in key candidate genes within the serotonin and dopamine systems and their impact on tobacco use. In addition to known functional variants, we will genotype over 250 SNPs in 17 candidate genes in 2,661 students from an existing cohort from Wuhan, China. A combination of genomic technologies, including high-throughput SNP genotyping on fiber optic array, GeneScan, Taqman assay and DNA sequencing, will be used to comprehensively profile genetic variations in the candidate genes.\\n\\nWe will investigate the relation of these polymorphisms to dispositional attributes, such as hostility and depression, and smoking and alcohol use outcomes. Additionally, we will examine important interaction effects of these polymorphisms combined with the effects from dispositional attributes and from a school-based intervention program.\\n\\nWe will implement hierarchical modeling to include knowledge regarding the biological mechanism for the serotonin and dopamine systems and Bayes model averaging to comprehensively evaluate the set of risk factors that best represents the underlying complexity of smoking behavior within a multifaceted social context.\\n\\nThe results of the proposed study should enhance our knowledge of genetic predisposition to smoking and allow us to create more effective prevention programs that are specifically tailored to the various subgroups identified in this work.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Genetic Variants \\u2014 Pacific Rim Tobacco & Alcohol Use Research Center\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/pacific-rim-tobacco-and-alcohol-use-research/projects/genetic-variants-and-tobacco-use-in-chinese-adolescents/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"* * *\\n\\nA study of 600 adolescent twin pairs in Southern California and another 600 twin pairs in Qingdao, China, that quantifies the nature of environmental influences and the extent to which they interact with genetic sources of variation in smoking-related behaviors.\\n\\n[View Project](https://research.cgu.edu/pacific-rim-tobacco-and-alcohol-use-research/projects/heritable-and-social-environment-risks-for-substance-use/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAn investigation of the effects that social, genetic, and neurocognitive underpinnings of dispositional characteristics \\u2014 particularly hostility and depression \\u2014 have on substance use uptake and progression, and how that moderates prevention and cessation program effects.\\n\\n[View Project](https://research.cgu.edu/pacific-rim-tobacco-and-alcohol-use-research/projects/effect-moderation-and-mediation-in-prevention-programs/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nA study focusing on genetic factors responsible for hostility, depression, and other dispositional attributes.

Their expertise ranges from classic business subjects like strategy and non-profit management to new fields like mindfulness. The work they do\\u2014whether publishing, breaking new research ground or lending their expertise\\u2014is changing the way we think about management.\\n\\nThe Drucker School of Management is led by a diverse group of distinguished faculty who are internationally known leaders in their fields. In many cases, they have come to us from other well-known schools in the world, such as Harvard, IMD, Stanford, and USC. They have come here for very similar reasons that our late colleague Peter Drucker did, when he arrived from NYU in 1971: because Claremont represents a unique small university/high-experience opportunity that results in remarkable and meaningful careers for our students.\\n\\nOur faculty are inspired to push the boundaries of business knowledge and practice. While they may publish in Harvard Business Review, win multiple lifetime achievement awards, and consult with top corporations in the world, that is not their primary motivation. Their primary motivation is to be here at the Drucker School, teaching talented and creative students like you who want to make a difference in the world, and understand that our approach is exactly what is needed to enable your success.\\n\\n##### Core Faculty\\n\\n![Image 1: David Sprott profile image](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DSM-David-Sprott-Web-600x600.jpg)\\n\\n#### David Sprott\\n\\nHenry Y.

Rather than defining Mormonism as a continuation of Christianity, Mormonism is better understood, Hickman maintains, as \\u201can envelope-pushing secular phenomenology\\u201d; that is, as a religion that opens up new possibilities for belief in a secular age. Mormonism\\u2019s function as a religion in a secular age is manifested through the Book of Mormon\\u2019s use of time. Hickman argues that the Book of Mormon challenges both secular and religious conceptions of time; respectively, the conceptions of clock time needed to run the secular state and the religious belief in a spiritual, eternal realm where time does not exist. Through its use of time, specifically messianic time, the Book of Mormon also challenges the \\u201ccolonial project\\u201d of European settlers by making the \\u201cindigenous people of the Americas\\u201d \\u201cthe primary actors in the building of a new heaven and new earth in their homeland.\\u201d Hickman explains that the Book of Mormon uses messianic time in an attempt to disrupt colonialism by teaching \\u201cmodern Native Americans\\u201d that they hold claim to the covenants of ancient Israel and by teaching them that \\u201cGod is on their side.\\u201d Additionally, the Book of Mormon offers a new approach to history through its phrase, \\u201cspeaking of things to come as though they had already come.\\u201d Hickman notes how characters in the Book of Mormon who lived before Christ were already living in the messianic moment; that is, living as if Christ had already died. For those living before Christ, then, messianic time had become part of the mundane. Finally, the Book of Mormon implies that the messianic moment (for example, the appearance of Christ in third Nephi) needs additional messianic moments to remain potent; after all, the Nephite utopia established after Christ\\u2019s appearance failed.\\n\\nBio:  \\nJared Hickman is assistant professor of English at Johns Hopkins University.\\u00a0 He researches the intersection of literature, religion, and race in the U.S. and the Atlantic world from the colonial period through the nineteenth century.\\u00a0 He is the author of\\u00a0_Black Prometheus: Race and Radicalism in the Age of Atlantic Slavery_\\u00a0(Oxford University Press, forthcoming) and co-editor of two volumes\\u2013with Martha Schoolman,\\u00a0_Abolitionist Places_\\u00a0(Routledge, 2013) and, with Elizabeth Fenton,\\u00a0_Americanist Approaches to_\\u00a0The Book of Mormon (Oxford University Press, forthcoming).\\u00a0 He has published articles in\\u00a0_American Literature, Early American Literature_,\\u00a0_The New England Quarterly_,\\u00a0_Nineteenth-Century Literature_,\\u00a0_PMLA_, and other venues.\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nShare\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Lecture: Jared Hickman on \\\"The Book of Mormon in a History of (Post) Secular Reading\\\" - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/jared-hickman-book-of-mormon-in-a-history-of-post-secular-reading/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Jay Orr is the dean of the School of Community & Global Health at the Claremont Graduate University and a clinical full professor.

Several of his students have abridged their papers so that they could be posted on this blog. The following reflection was written by **Catrina Ellis**, a first-year Master\\u2019s student in religion at CGU for whom Mormon Studies is a concentration. Names have been changed._\\n\\nWhat resonated most in my three hours at church was the emphasis on life. The building was full of life, and the service centered on life. The room was filled with sound\\u2014laughter, crying, talking, screaming. Audible conversations before the sacrament meeting were not only permitted but encouraged. These congregants were happy to be spending their Sunday together, for they genuinely liked each other. I overheard one woman saying to a man she had just embraced, \\u201cI love being at Church. It\\u2019s so uplifting,\\u201d and it appeared most others would have agreed with her.\\n\\nThe pews were another example of the emphasis on life and community. Growing up Roman Catholic, I am accustomed to pews as a source of pain. Uncomfortable pews and kneelers discriminate against the injured and elderly. These pews, however, lacked kneelers and included padded cushions. They did not imply that at least a modicum of discomfort is necessary for worship. Furthermore, pews, as opposed to individual chairs, promote community. Neighbors are in each other\\u2019s space; physical closeness accompanies the emotional bonds of communal worship.\\n\\nAnother marked difference between a Roman Catholic Mass and this Mormon worship service was the constant presence of children\\u2019s voices, a persistent (and often loud) reminder of the presence and value of new life. An overwhelming shushing was not the harbinger of the beginning of the service, and within reason, children were permitted to be children. One boy in the pew across from me was in a ball on the floor, and his father did not immediately snatch him off the ground; rather, he simply held onto the boy\\u2019s pants to prevent the repeated attempts to crawl away. Later, the boy began kicking the hymnbooks and the girl\\u2019s head in front of him, and when that did not garner further attention, he screamed. This behavior would have forced Catholic parents to forcibly remove him, but he was merely remonstrated quietly. Many of the children were also allowed to eat. One boy was handed gummies after emitting an alarming shriek, which he ate looking immensely pleased with himself, and many others proudly held little bags of Cheerios. The tolerated presence of rowdy children demonstrates the same understanding that was apparent when latecomers were neither glared at nor expected to sit in the back: life happens, and it does not prevent one\\u2019s ability to participate in Church.\\n\\nThe content of the service itself similarly centered around life. Sermons concentrated on the here and now; only one mentioned the afterlife. Both the bishop and stake president spoke about setting reasonable goals to become \\u201ca little better, a little closer to Christ,\\u201d not lofty ones which devalue everyday life. Bishop Jackson even took the grandiose song lyric, \\u201cHome can be a heaven on earth,\\u201d down to earth, so to speak. Using an anecdote about his wife\\u2019s epic struggles to prevent their two sons from beating each other in the pew, he assured the congregation that these words were meant to be aspirational, not necessarily descriptive. Along the same vein, the church was described as a hospital for sinners, not a shrine for saints; in other words, the struggles and temptations of life are acknowledged as real and difficult, for those who come to church are not expected to be perfect, exalted beings.\\n\\nEven less obvious aspects of the service demonstrated that normal, worldly life was permitted to enter the church. For example, the sacrament passed around was a generic wheat bread, not a specialized host, and easily obtained tap water, rather than some exotic drink. There is power in saying that everyday sandwich bread and water are sufficient reminders of Christ.\\n\\nThese examples contribute to the lack of mysticism in the church. There were no candles, no incense; the building was brightly lit, and all was visible. The sacrament was not a miracle performed by God through human agency but rather a remembrance. Even the fact that all speakers, office holders, and missionaries were named permitted them to maintain identity rather than becoming bodiless, interchangeable roles.\\n\\nThese individuals\\u2019 authority did not separate them from the community, however. Even the stake president remained a part of this family. When he spoke, he asked the congregation to pray for him, which demonstrated both his level of humility in an authoritative position and that his title did not inherently place him on a pedestal, detached from the congregation. Further, he addressed the congregation as brothers and sisters. This terminology promotes equality of status among the community, but the stake president using it demonstrates that despite his higher position, he remains a brother. Catholic priests, in contrast, would greet their \\u201cchildren\\u201d; they become fathers and consequently are ideologically separated from their flock.\\n\\nThis community also made multiple attempts to assure me that I was entirely welcome. The Relief Society president approached me before the worship service to introduce herself, and she clearly announced my presence to the bishop and stake president, for both made sure to welcome all visitors while looking in my direction. Both also must have come over at least three times each after the first service to welcome me and ensure that I knew where Sunday School and the bathroom were. Sister Knight summed up this welcoming spirit in the Relief Society meeting. She reminded that even simply saying hello is touching another person\\u2019s life, and that hello might have been just what was needed to lift that person\\u2019s spirit.\\n\\nThe remainder of the Relief Society meeting stressed the importance of love as well, but self-love rather than communal love. It was clear that the woman who led the meeting was greatly concerned about the lack of self-confidence and self-love among her sisters. The second activity consisted of tossing around a ball of yarn and each woman naming her own best quality. Some of the older women had enough self-confidence to say something, but many of the younger women could only list mundane qualities, such as washing dishes, if they could say anything at all. The leader finally had to resort to having the other women compliment the yarn-holder, and they were perfectly willing to say wonderful things about others, just not themselves.\\n\\nBishop Jackson was very affected by this, and he made a small speech, saying that he supposed being unassuming was one of their qualities but he hoped they knew they were loved and appreciated by their ward family. The leader was very thankful he spoke up and shared an emotional personal story of her revelation in the temple in which she asked God why she was still alone and if God still loved her, and God told her that she alone was loved and precious. The anecdote seemed to resonate with the other women, and I hope it will help them accept their worth as well.\\n\\nMy experience at the Mormon church was very positive and welcoming. There were other apparent themes, but at their essence, the services and congregation promoted life and community.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Spending Sunday Morning in the Mormon Family - Claremont Mormon Studies\", \"source\": \"https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/students/student-writings/spending-sunday-morning-in-the-mormon-family/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"A leader in open data, education, community-building, and civic innovation, Jeanne Holm is the Deputy Mayor for the City of Los Angeles.

Though she had a \\u201csimple childhood,\\u201d she looks back on her childhood fondly. As an adult, she became a physician and was married for ten years until she eventually divorced. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989, many people were displaced out of Russia, Tatiana included. She moved to Lithuania for two years and continued to work as a physician until she met an American. They quickly fell in love and married two weeks after they first met.\\n\\nTatiana\\u2019s new husband was a Latter-day Saint. Though she didn\\u2019t know much about Mormonism, she thought that such a nice gentleman couldn\\u2019t be involved in anything bad, so she began attending their local congregation when they moved to the United States. One thing that stood out to her right away was the church\\u2019s emphasis on families. Everything in the church seemed to be centered around families, something she had never really thought about before, which she says may have contributed to her divorce. She was impressed with how this church was committed to helping people build strong families. She did have some issues with the church\\u2019s stance on tea and strong drinks though, as tea culture is an extremely important part of Russian tradition. It was also initially difficult for her to believe that members in her congregation could be so sincere\\u2014they seemed so sweet and humble. It took her a long time to accept that they were genuine. For these sincere Latter-day Saints, church wasn\\u2019t just a place to hang out on Sundays, it was a way of life. And so, in time, her doubts and struggles diminished.\\n\\nLooking back on her experiences, she says, \\u201cThere are so many ways to measure your success in this life. Some people measure it with a bank account, with property they own. Some people measure it with the amount of gold medals they won, with fame and power. I thought a lot about it. I measure my success by the amount of light. The more light I get in this life, the more successful I consider myself. Light that makes you happy, like peace and joy\\u2014and the ability to be happy for somebody else as well, not to be eaten up to death by jealousy or hatred. But just to have experiences that overwhelm you with feelings of love for people. It doesn\\u2019t come instantly, no. It\\u2019s not an event, it\\u2019s a process.

The second part of the course will develop important techniques of finding general solutions for the classical partial differential equations (the wave equation, the diffusion equation and Laplace\\u2019s equation ) in explicit form.\\n\\nCourse Coordinator:\\n\\nMarina Chugunova, HU 1025, (416) 946-3769, chugunom@math.utoronto.ca  \\n_Lectures:_\\u00a0Monday (10:00 \\u2013 11:00) MP102, Tuesday (14:00 \\u2013 16:00) LM159  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0Tuesday (16:00 \\u2013 18:00) HU 1025\\n\\nCourse Instructor:\\n\\nGideon Simpson, BA 1025, 416-978-5214, simpson@math.utoronto.ca  \\n_Lectures:_\\u00a0Monday (10:00 \\u2013 11:00) MP103, Tuesday (14:00 \\u2013 16:00) SF1105\\n\\nTutorial Instructors:\\n\\nHadi Ghasemi, ghasemi@mie.utoronto.ca,\\u00a0_Tutorial 01:_\\u00a0Monday (16:00 \\u2013 17:30) SF3201  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0Tuesday (5-6 pm) MC304  \\nFarbod Nassiri, farbod.nassiri@utoronto.ca,\\u00a0_Tutorial 02:_\\u00a0Monday (16:00 \\u2013 17:30) HA403  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0Friday (3-4pm) MC314F  \\nDan Sellan, dan.sellan@utoronto.ca,\\u00a0_Tutorial 03:_\\u00a0Tuesday (10:00 \\u2013 11:30) HA403  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0by appointment, just send an e-mail and you\\u2019ll get one  \\nPatrick Woods, pwoods@mie.utoronto.ca,\\u00a0_Tutorial 04:_\\u00a0Tuesday (10:00 \\u2013 11:30) SF3202  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a01:00PM to 2:00PM on Mondays ROOM RS 313 (in the Rosebrugh building)\\n\\nTeaching Assistants:\\n\\nWinnie Chen, hwchen@mie.utoronto.ca  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0Thursday April 2nd, 2 \\u2013 3 pm at the Lab.

Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: \\u201cGrade of F assigned for academic dishonesty\\u201d), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.

The center is a nonprofit research institute that studies positive psychology \\u2014 that is, human strengths such as creativity, engagement, intrinsic motivation, and responsibility.\\n\\nIn the past, the study of behavior has focused mainly on what goes wrong in human affairs: aggression, mental disease, failure and hopelessness. While it is essential to study and address such pathologies, it is equally important to understand those aspects of human experience that make life worth living. The center conducts research on such issues, and provides a forum for scholars from the U.S. and abroad who wish to extend their studies in positive psychology.\\n\\nGraduate programs in positive psychology were launched in the fall of 2007 through the School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation, Division of Behavioral and Organizational Sciences and Department of Psychology. The PhD programs in Positive Organizational Psychology and Positive Developmental Psychology provide research training in positive psychology. MA co-concentrations in Evaluation and either Positive Organizational Psychology or Positive Developmental Psychology are also offered.\\n\\n### Research\\n\\nThe center is currently conducting research projects on the sources of good mentoring with a grant from the Spencer Foundation, and on well-being as part of the cross-national Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation. Other research the center is currently pursuing include the study of everyday life using experience sampling methods and the study of good work in the second half of life.\\n\\nWith the help of grants from the Fetzer, Ford, Hewlett, Spencer, and Templeton Foundations, the center has conducted research jointly with Harvard and Stanford universities on the conditions that make good work in the professions possible.

For two outstanding poets each year, the Kingsley and Kate Tufts awards represent both.\\n\\nThe Tufts poetry awards\\u2014based at Claremont Graduate University and given for poetry volumes published in the preceding year\\u2014are not only two of the most prestigious prizes a contemporary poet can receive, they also come with hefty purses: $100,000 for the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award and $10,000 for the Kate Tufts Discovery Award. This makes the Kingsley Tufts award the world\\u2019s largest monetary prize for a single collection of poetry. And for most poets who have just published their first collection of verse, $10,000 should keep the pen scribbling.\\n\\nCalling the Winners of the 2024 Kingsley & Kate Tufts Poetry Awards\\n\\nKingsley Tufts Poetry Award\\n---------------------------\\n\\nUnlike many literary awards, which are coronations for a successful career or body of work, the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award was created to both honor the poet and provide the resources that allow artists to continue working towards the pinnacle of their craft.\\n\\n\\u201cBecause the award comes to you at mid-career, and is supposed to be a stepping stone and not a tombstone, it nerves you up to try to write up to the mark already set by the previous winners,\\u201d said Tom Sleigh, the 2008 recipient.\\n\\nKate Tufts \\u2013 widow of Kingsley Tufts, and creator of the award \\u2013 had said she wanted to create a prize \\u201cthat would enable a poet to work on his or her craft for awhile without paying bills.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is a tall order honoring the vision that Kate Tufts set out for us . . . to sustain a poet who is laboring in the difficult middle between first flower and final bloom,\\u201d said CGU Associate Professor Patricia Easton, who is the former director of the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Awards. \\u201cYet, somehow, the judges have managed to select truly exceptional poets year after year, poets who have gone on to write even greater volumes of poetry.\\u201d\\n\\nKate Tufts Discovery Award\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe Kate Tufts Discovery Award was created in 1994, a year after the inception of the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award. It is presented to a first book by a poet of genuine promise.\\u00a0 The Kate Tufts Discovery Award offers a hefty prize of $10,000.\\n\\nWhile the Kate Tufts award offers financial compensation and increased visibility, it also offers additional, intangible benefits. Many poets labor for years without receiving meaningful feedback, save for piles of rejection letters from literary journals and perhaps, for the luckiest and most talented, a handful of published pieces. Even then, while getting a poem published is encouraging, one can never be sure about the audience: its size, its response, or even if it really exists.\\n\\n\\u201cThe award is a confidence builder,\\u201d said Janice Harrington, the 2008 winner. \\u201cIt\\u2019s that bit of light in the darkness that allows you to see your way, so that you can keep trying to write your best poetry.\\u201d\\n\\nEric McHenry, who won the 2007 Kate Tufts award for _Potscrubber Lullabies,_ also noted the value of affirmation:\\n\\n\\u201cWriting poetry is hard work, not least because it requires me to convince myself that the world needs my poems. The best thing about winning this award is the feeling that my book has found some enthusiastic readers, that it isn\\u2019t so unwelcome in the world.\\u201d\\n\\nCGU\\u2019s Connection\\n----------------\\n\\nDuring the holiday season for a number of decades, Kate and Kingsley invited a living room full of friends to engage in a joyous poetry reading. At the 1991 gathering, Kingsley finished his reading, closed his eyes, and died.\\n\\nFor nearly a year, Kate pondered which institution should be approached to realize her dream\\u2013a special kind of award to honor a poet with Kingsley\\u2019s name and a stipend.\\n\\nHer cousin, my friend Norman Clement, urged me that summer to call upon her and tell her of my interest\\u2013and the then-Claremont Graduate School\\u2019s\\u2013in her vision. It blossomed\\u2013love at first sight\\u2013into the awards program we continue to celebrate today.\\n\\nPoets of every stripe have contributed, creating a bouquet of surrounding depth and beauty: a genuine national treasure. It has grown into a major award and the Kingsley & Kate Tufts Poetry Awards is one of the most cherished legacies of my presidency.\\n\\n\\\\-John Maguire, President, Claremont Graduate School, 1981-1998\\n\\nThe Kingsley & Kate Tufts Poetry Awards are housed in CGU\\u2019s [School of Arts & Humanities](https://www.cgu.edu/school/school-of-arts-and-humanities/).

It is 8:00AM in the morning. You sit in front of your desk and turn on your computer. After a couple minutes of relaxing and browsing through your Facebook feed, you open your inbox and think to yourself, \\u201cOh no! How am I supposed to respond all these emails on top of some left over emails from yesterday?\\u201d Then, you jump into the virtual world of communication \\u2014 trying to set up a meeting with your boss, responding to your clients\\u2019 emails, and following up with your colleagues. But how would you know if your emails have upset someone? How can you be certain that you address every important issue in your emails? How do you know if you are communicating via emails effectively?\\n\\nIn this digital era, it is inevitable that you will have to communicate with other people via emails regarding both personal and work-related issues. In some ways, it\\u2019s like we have become more and more enslaved to email. Email overload leads you to feel obligated to respond quickly, overwhelmed, afraid of missing information, and eventually addicted to emails.\\n\\nNow it is 1:00 PM, you have just got back from your lunch break. You realize that you need to have a discussion with your team about a new project. You are planning to use a group email thread to communicate with your team about this matter instead of scheduling a time to meet. You start an email thread and leave your office for a couple hours to attend a meeting with your client. When you come back, you see that you have more than 20 new email messages from that thread alone. On top of that, two of the people on your team send emails to complain about how the thread is so distracting.\\n\\nBeing a good leader is more than just being able to lead a meeting or create a shared vision for your team. Being a good leader is reflected in your email communication skills as well. Good leaders concern themselves with their followers\\u2019 well-being and since email communication is a big part of your followers\\u2019 work routine, it is important that you understand how to effectively use this tool\\n\\nBased on my experience assessing leader\\u2019s behaviors in an email communication simulation, which we offer at the LeAD Labs, I have seen how leaders respond to this email task differently. Some of them focus entirely on getting work done and try to accomplish the tasks as much and as quickly as possible. Other people spend more time making sure that his or her emails look friendly and professional. At our assessment center, our assessor team uses Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS) as criteria to provide each leader scores and feedback. The four main criteria we use for evaluating leadership in email communication are Planning and Organizing, Problem Solving, Relationship Maintenance, and Written Communication. I will provide some practical recommendations that you can use based on my experience and research following these four criteria.\\n\\nPlanning and Organizing\\n-----------------------\\n\\nScheduling specific timeslots to check and respond your email is a good strategy. Research shows that it takes some time (about 15-20 minutes) to refocus on your original task if you are interrupted by emails. This strategy will help to reduce interruption throughout the day (for you and your followers). Although scheduling time to check email can be different depending on types of jobs, a general recommendation is to check email two to four times a day.\\n\\nProblem Solving\\n---------------\\n\\nOne of the major problems in email communication comes from the sheer number of emails we all get. Often times in our simulation we find that some people do not address every important issue in each email. This may lead to a long email thread because the sender has to send another email to follow-up with you regarding missing information. You have to ensure that you respond to every question or request that comes up in your emails. This does not mean that you have to solve every single problem or have every answer for all questions. But you need to at least provide an update to the sender. This will help reduce email volume and enhance credibility.\\n\\nRelationship Maintenance\\n------------------------\\n\\nResearch shows that receivers tend to perceive messages in email communication less positively or even more negatively than the sender intended them to be. This means a good leader should be careful about what they decide to email to their followers instead of meeting with them face-to-face. In fact, research shows that \\u201c56% of employees agreed email is used too often instead of phone or face-to-face communication.\\u201d It might be a good idea for leaders to occasionally call his or her followers, or talk to them directly, instead of automatically sending off another email. This will not only reduce email volume, foster better relationships between leaders and followers, but also ensure that the correct emotional message is being communicated.\\n\\nWritten Communication\\n---------------------\\n\\nSince emails tend to be read more negatively than face-to-face or phone communication, you need to structure your emails in a way that readers can easily follow. Before hitting the send button, you should make sure to read through your emails again in order to check your addressees, the flow of the email, and grammatical or spelling errors. It is also a good idea to include openings and closings that directly get to the point or summarize the action to be taken.\\n\\nThese recommendations do not mean to be an exhaustive list, but rather a means to provide a starting point to be an effective leader via email communication. This list is a good starting point for those of you who want to be more effective in your email communication. Given the importance of email in most organizations today it is a good idea to make sure your skills are up to date and not holding you back from being as effective a leader as you could be.\\n\\n_At LeAD Labs, you can participate in our Assessment Center.

My name is Marcus Weakley, we are beginning a new chapter today in reimagining the podcast with a broader focus than just writing. And I couldn\\u2019t be happier than to welcome Dr. Kendall Cotton Bronk, to this inaugural new reimagining episode. In terms of a brief introduction, Dr. Bronk, is an associate professor of psychology in the division of behavioral and social sciences at Claremont Graduate University. She\\u2019s a developmental psychologist interested in understanding and supporting the positive development and moral growth of young people.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nTo this end, she leads the Adolescent Moral Development Lab, which focuses on addressing primary questions around purpose and youth. Her work has been funded by the Spencer Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the Fulbright Foundation. We\\u2019re going to go more in-depth about her specific research focus in terms of purpose in youth. But in addition to her substantive interest, she has also helped define and outline the parameters of something called the exemplar methodology, which we\\u2019ll talk about more. And of course, teaches masters in doctoral classes on a range of topics at Claremont Graduate University. Thank you so much for joining me.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThanks for having me, Marcus. I\\u2019m glad to be here.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nGreat, awesome. Before we jump in, I just wanted to give our listeners a bit of a background into this shift in the podcast. What I\\u2019m thinking of doing now, moving away from just talking about topics around writing, the last episode on transdisciplinary thinking, which was supposed to be an integration of transdisciplinary thinking and writing, kind of inspired me, I\\u2019m really interested in different epistemologies, ways of approaching knowledge and building knowledge and how those transfer into the tools of academic study, right? Or even professional studies.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nHow those transfers into theories, practices, assumptions, methods and definitely different standards of reliability, verification, the things that when we learn how to research the world, or a phenomenon through a discipline, we might learn in practice and take for granted. I\\u2019m interested in looking at those, in folks that are doing work in different areas of academic research, and having some good discussions around that and what interesting elements we can bring to light in honing and focusing in on the background, the theories behind pursuits of knowledge and understanding.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nFor our episode today, that means we\\u2019re going to look at psychology and positive psychology more specifically. I would like to start general and then move more specific, if that\\u2019s okay. The first question Dr. Bronk is, psychology is a science or often considered a social science. What does typical psychological research do to study phenomenon?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThat\\u2019s a good question. Psychologists we\\u2019re really interested in understanding human behavior, and in order to do that, we tend to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods. We also use experimental research and quasi experimental research. So just a little bit about each of those, quantitative research methods often employ surveys, you might go and administer a bunch of surveys to people to get a sense of how many people across the country, how many young people have a sense of purpose in their lives.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nQualitative research more often relies on things like interviews, or focus groups, or observations. If you wanted to understand not just how many people had purpose but what a purpose looks in the lives of young people, you might conduct interviews with some of those people who scored particularly high on your survey. According to your survey, they score high and appear to have a purpose, and then you might go conduct an interview to understand what does that purpose look like? How does it shape their lives? We often use quantitative and qualitative research methods together to study a whole range of psychological phenomena.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nGreat, how would you describe the theory behind qualitative and quantitative study of human behavior? What are some of the major views about the world and acquiring knowledge that validates those methods? What about asking via surveys or an interviews the way that you\\u2019re approaching and then the types of answers and the way you deal with those answers? How are you assured to get the types of outcomes you\\u2019re looking for, a clear picture of definitions of what human purpose looks like in the survey case, I mean, maybe statistical data about whatever questions you\\u2019re asking?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWell, you\\u2019re looking for an overarching theory that underscores or explains how we think about gathering data on human behavior?\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah, and analyzing it. I mean, how are you assured that the answers you receive on the survey will be validated in a way where you can with certainty say, \\u201cYes, this X is occurring given we\\u2019ve gathered about the survey,\\u201d and then we can determine these other maybe next paths forward, some other treatment, or something else. Just the reliability more or less. How is that validated by the methods that are used by psychology?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nI usually conduct qualitative research and there\\u2019s really a whole different set of assumptions that underlie quantitative approaches versus qualitative approaches. There are philosophical assumptions and interpretive frameworks, and they vary between the two different approaches. The idea behind quantitative approaches tends to be more of a positivistic approach. And again, here I\\u2019m simplifying, I should note that there\\u2019s more than one approach.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nBut mostly we think about the positivist approach, which is this idea that there is an objective reality that we can study and we can get on it by trying to remove the researcher from the research process and trying to use things like surveys and this kind of thing to get people to share their picture of that reality with the researchers. And with a qualitative approach, we don\\u2019t assume there is one objective reality. Instead, there\\u2019s really this assumption that there are multiple subjective realities and that people\\u2019s conception of how the world works and why they act the way they\\u2026 It really varies based on their own experiences.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd so in qualitative research, we don\\u2019t, like I said, we don\\u2019t assume is one objective reality. Instead, we assume there are multiple subjective realities, and this is why we go straight to participants and talk with them to try to understand what their subjective reality looks like. There\\u2019s also this assumption that the researcher is not necessarily absent from the research process, which is more of what the assumption that guides quantitative approaches. In qualitative work, we recognize that the researcher is really like almost one of the research tools, right?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nBecause based on your own background as a researcher, you bring certain experiences to the data gathering process. What kinds of are you even going to ask? And what kinds of responses are you really going to pay attention to? And which ones might you not pay so close of attention to? What questions do you ask? What questions do you not ask? We recognize that the researcher is a part, a very active part of the research process.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nIt\\u2019s important for the researcher to try to bracket their experience and set it aside in qualitative research, because we really do want to understand the participants\\u2019 conception of reality not just the researchers. And so in qualitative research, we have a number of tools, or strategies, or approaches that we can employ to bracket the researchers experience so that we can really understand our participants subjective experience of reality.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nAnd that sounds a challenge to me. If you want to mind, I would love to hear a bit more about what you think might be an interesting, maybe representative example of one of these tools in order to remove the maybe implicit bias or the other sorts of things that a researcher might bring to the study?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nYeah, of course. I mean, we actually see that what a researcher can bring to the research process, we don\\u2019t always think of it as negative, right? There\\u2019s sometimes being on an inside, on the inside being a part of the group that you\\u2019re interviewing. That can have some advantages, because you know what the issues are, you know what the problems might be, you know where to look for the right answers.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThat\\u2019s why in qualitative research, we don\\u2019t necessarily say you have to completely eradicate the role of the researcher. You want to use it to the extent that it\\u2019s useful. On the other hand, you do want to understand\\u2026 You don\\u2019t want to be so blinded by your own perspective that you don\\u2019t hear what others are saying, especially if they might disagree or have a different conception of reality than you do.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nOne of the things that we do as qualitative researchers is to write, before you begin a research project, we write an identity memo. And in this memo, it\\u2019s not really a one time thing. It\\u2019s more of a process, but you sit down and you write about who you are and what expectations and biases and experiences you bring to this particular research project. If you are researching purpose, it might make sense for you to sit down and think about, well, what does it mean to you to have a purpose in life?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd what is your purpose and how does you discover it? And all of these kinds of things are going to shape the way that you interview somebody else about purpose. And so it\\u2019s really good to have it down on paper to be really aware of your own perspectives so that hopefully you can stay open to the possibility that it may be really quite different for somebody else.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThis identity memo, and like I said, that\\u2019s something that we revisit throughout the course of the research project, so that as you hear new things, you can try to really stay open to the possibility that other people\\u2019s experiences might differ from your own. The identity memo is one approach. Something else we often do is conduct qualitative research in teams. Sometimes it can be helpful to have an insider perspective from maybe one member of the team, but some outside perspective from other members of the team.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWe\\u2019re doing some research now in Liberia, and we\\u2019re really trying to understand what does positive youth development look in a librarian culture? Most of us, the members of our team are not librarian, but we do have some librarian researchers who are members of the team. And I think have the two perspectives together, we can bounce ideas off one another and serve as a check for one another.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nHaving teams, I think one of the other things we often do are member checks. Again, in quantitative research, we really assume the participant is just a participant, they just provide the source of data. But in qualitative research, we often think of the participant as almost a co-investigator with us. They\\u2019re the experts, they\\u2019re the ones who understand, they have this subjective sense of reality, they\\u2019re expert in it. And we\\u2019re trying to understand it.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWe do like member checks, which means at the end of our data collection effort, we might go back to some of our participants and say, \\u201cJust want to make sure I really understood this correctly, we thought you said this.\\u201d And these member checks are another opportunity for you to really just ensure that you\\u2019re getting the perspective from your participant and hearing what they\\u2019re saying and not interpreting it. I mean, you\\u2019re definitely going to interpret it through your own lens, but not so much that you\\u2019re not hearing what they\\u2019re actually saying. Those are a few of the strategies that we use.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nThat\\u2019s great. I like all of those, to be honest with you. I had never heard of the identity memo before this and I really the idea of building in a self-reflective process like that, to understand your own positionality a bit in regards to the research site that you\\u2019re doing. And a big part of transdisciplinary research is the idea of moving towards really a community research model and what you were talking about there. I mean, having team members from Liberia, in the example that you gave, is really a big step in that direction, where it\\u2019s like, you\\u2019re not going to be able to ensure as well that the research that you are doing within the community is beneficial for that community without having some, I guess, insider knowledge or folks from that community itself taking part in the research. I think those are great examples.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nYeah, I think that\\u2019s right. Yeah, thank you. Good.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI would love to transition over a bit now from the more just general background of psychology as a whole, both in the quantitative and qualitative senses and move more towards positive psychology specifically. From my understanding, positive psychology is a relatively recent development in the field and it was developed, I mean, correct me if I\\u2019m wrong at any point with this. It was developed to fill a gap in many respects in the field, not necessarily saying that the field is wrong so much as a lot of previous psychological research hadn\\u2019t taken into account a whole area of human behavior.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI mean, it had focused in what I\\u2019ve heard called the disease model, more in terms of let\\u2019s diagnose, let\\u2019s define disorders, let\\u2019s measure or classify them, come up with reliable diagnoses, understand causation, and then see if we can treat or possibly even cure these disorders that had left out a huge area of human behavior that positive psychology developed to study in more depth. Could you maybe start by telling us a bit about this comparison here about the disease model, and then a bit about what positive psychology did differently to help us understand the latter a bit more?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nOf course. Historically, I think the aims of psychology have been to really work with people who are struggling. People who might be clinically depressed or dealing with high, high levels of anxiety, and the goal has really been to address those shortcomings, to help people to feel less depressed and to feel less anxious so that they could hopefully go on and live healthy lives.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd I think that in the early 2000s, and there were some examples of positive psychology popping up a little bit before this, but right around 2000 Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, published a pretty significant piece in American psychologists, where they introduced this idea of positive psychology. And they really talked about how as psychologists, maybe we\\u2019re not doing enough just to alleviate people\\u2019s depression and anxiety and other kinds of negative mental states.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nMaybe that\\u2019s not enough, maybe we should be doing more, just because people are not clinically depressed doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean they\\u2019re living full and healthy, happy lives. And so as psychologists, they begin to wonder if maybe there wasn\\u2019t more to be done. And so they introduced this idea of positive psychology. And along with that, it\\u2019s a new view of health. Health isn\\u2019t just the\\u2026 And actually the world health organization adopted this definition, which is cool. It\\u2019s not just the absence of negative health issues, but also the presence of positive health. And so really that\\u2019s been the goal of positive psychologists, is to understand not just how to eradicate negative states, but how to encourage positive states of health and wellbeing.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nAwesome, what are some of the major areas that positive psychology focuses on to understand more about this?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWell, I think one of the first things that we had to really tackle was what does positive health look like, right? It\\u2019s pretty easy to identify negative health. We have the DSM 5 and all of these diagnostic and statistical manuals that help us really categorize and recognize and diagnose all the different psychological problems that people can can be dealing with, but we really didn\\u2019t have any what does positive health look like?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd so early in the study, that was really where the focus was, is trying to identify what does it mean to be thriving or to be flourishing, or what are these different terms refer to? And so we\\u2019ve had a number of psychologists, positive psychologists who have put forth different theories, theoretical frameworks for what it means to be thriving. Some of these have focused, we\\u2019ve got researchers who deal with older adults. And so they\\u2019ve looked at positive aging. What does it mean to be flourishing later in the life span?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThere\\u2019s also a lot of research interested in younger people. There\\u2019s an area of positive youth development. What does it mean to be thriving as a young person? I think that\\u2019s really where we started, and then we also did need some new methods, because is a lot of the approaches that we\\u2019ve taken have looked at\\u2026 If you think about the whole range of human functioning, you have people who are deficit in an area, typical in an area. And that\\u2019s really where we stopped, but of course, you also have people who are really exceptional in an area.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nIf you look at things know positive effect, right? Is somebody who is deficit would be probably depressed. Somebody who\\u2019s typical might have some amount of it, but what would somebody look who is really thriving? It displays lots of positive effect. And that\\u2019s where this exemplar methodology came in, this is something that my colleagues and I, it\\u2019s not something that we really developed. I mean, an exemplar methodology has existed and been used here and there for long before I came along. But we really tried to sit down and better lay out what it looks to conduct exemplar studies. And in these exemplar studies, we\\u2019re really interested in that last group, the people who do something really well. It\\u2019s really-\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nWhat are some of the challenges then in measuring or studying that aren\\u2019t present? Are you just looking for, I don\\u2019t know, deficit behaviors?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nRight. Well, I mean, it\\u2019s more difficult to use just a random sample. A lot of times you want to look\\u2026 We\\u2019ve studied things bravery, what does an exemplar of bravery look like? What does an exemplar of care look like? What does an exemplar of purpose look like? And usually if you really want to hone in on those exemplars, you can\\u2019t use just a random sample. You have to get a good sense of what it is that you\\u2019re looking for and use some nominated sample, which is again, why I\\u2019ve conducted more qualitative research, which tends to rely more on nominated samples.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThat can make it tough, I think one of the other things is that when you\\u2019re looking at nominated samples, you often don\\u2019t have as large of a sample size. There was a study conducted in Canada by some researchers at the university of British Columbia, and they were interested in looking at bravery and care exemplars. And as it turns out that Canadian government actually gives awards for bravery and for caring each year. I know. Right?\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nIt sounds like something that would exist, I don\\u2019t know.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nExactly, it sounds very Canadian, doesn\\u2019t it? And so they used as their criteria for identifying exemplars of bravery and care, there criteria was that it had to be somebody who had won one of these awards. And so that\\u2019s an important thing hen you\\u2019re are looking at an exemplary sample, you have to have really clear criteria for what constitutes exemplary behavior in whatever construct it is you\\u2019re trying to study.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nDo these criteria change given cultural context? Let\\u2019s use brave bravery as an example. I mean, my sense is the cultural inner subjective agreements that often exist. I can imagine there being a different picture of bravery in Liberia, for example, than here in the United States, or even in different groups in the United States, is that a challenge as well?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThat is definitely a challenge. Yeah, definitely a challenge. And again, with qualitative research, the goal is not\\u2026 And not all of this research, this one particular study was actually more quantitative in nature, but a lot of the exemplar studies tend to be more qualitative in nature. And in qualitative studies, because we\\u2019re working with a nominated sample, we don\\u2019t usually try to generalize our findings.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWhat we\\u2019re trying to do is say, if people\\u2019s experiences are going to differ, so this isn\\u2019t necessarily everybody\\u2019s experience, but here are what some of these experiences look like. And so, yes, you would definitely want to note that it\\u2019s only among individuals gathered from this particular culture and not even just culture, but also time, right? Over time, our conception of what it means to be brave has changed. I think today a big characteristic of bravery is often people who engage in whistleblower activities and that might not have a period decades, hundreds of years ago. I think it\\u2019s constrained by time and by culture and by a variety of variables.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nCool. Then just moving from there, it seems another important aspect of positive psychology is giving folks things that they can do to increase these aspects of life, right? So if you want to be happier, if you want to maybe increase the meaning of your life, you can try this or that technique. Can you tell us a bit about some of those maybe specifically in your own work, and then also how you\\u2026 Given the way that you study, where you\\u2019re just trying to talk about something that\\u2019s going on in a specific slice of time with a specific group of people. How are you able to take that study and then transfer it into recommendation to increase the purpose of your life and things along those lines?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nI actually consider myself more of a developmental scientist. And one of the goals of developmental scientists are to describe, explain and optimize wellbeing. We try to understand how people describe what do these positive states look like, explain how do individuals achieve them. And then optimize, how can we like you said, turn these into practices that other people can use?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd I think it that\\u2019s one of the big appeals of positive psychology is that, it\\u2019s not just we know how something works and we put it up on the shelf and leave it there. We really do try to put it into action, if we understand how people can live healthier, happier, fuller lives. We want to share that information with people who can put it into practice.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nVery practical, definitely. Definitely think it\\u2019s a-\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nYeah, I agree, because I feel that\\u2019s not always where psychology was. There was really a time where the focus was on basic psychology and we just needed to understand how all of these things worked. And that was kind of that was it, then we were done. And today I think that\\u2019s changing, and I think there\\u2019s, especially at CGO, that\\u2019s really, I think one of the things that sets CGO apart, there\\u2019s a very strong focus on applied research. So taking what we\\u2019re doing and helping to apply it.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWith purpose in particular, we\\u2019ve definitely been interested in, I mean, we know that individuals who lead a life of purpose report all kinds of physical and psychological health benefits. So they\\u2019re happier, they\\u2019re more hopeful, they\\u2019re more optimistic. From a physical health perspective, they have better cardiovascular functioning, they sleep better. They live longer lives. I know, right? It\\u2019s pretty significant.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI could use a few of those, I think.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThere you go. Yeah, no, there\\u2019s some really interesting research too, that suggests these aren\\u2019t just correlation. It\\u2019s not just a correlation, it\\u2019s actually, there\\u2019s some interesting epigenetic research going on in med schools. And they look at different genotypes and phenotypes and all of this, but we know that the different ways that you live your life affect the different ways that your genes express themselves and individuals who live their lives, lives of purpose, tend to have very healthy genetic expressions, which is, leads to things better immuno functioning and really interesting research going on there.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nBut anyway, so we knew that leading a life of purpose was a good thing. And then we also knew that it was actually relatively rare. Again, we did those surveys where we were looking at individuals across the lifespan, or at least across the first half of the life I span in trying to understand how frequently do people lead life\\u2019s of purpose? And it\\u2019s not as frequent as you\\u2019d think, purpose tends to develop in adolescence and into adulthood.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd I think we probably still need some more research to really get our arms around exactly how prevalent it is. But at least the early research in this space suggests only about one in three young adults in their twenties reports leading a life of purpose. And so taking these two findings together that leading a life of purpose is a good thing. And yet it\\u2019s pretty rare, we did start thinking about, well, how could we cultivate purpose? What are some steps we could take to help individuals discover a purpose for their lives.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd actually some of our work in this space got started by accident, which is just the way all good psychological research should go, right? But we were conducting these inner surveys I should say, of purpose, and like I said, we were surveying thousands of young people across the country and trying to understand how frequently people reported leading a life of purpose. And then we just randomly selected a subset of those young people to conduct interviews with.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd it was so interesting to conduct these interviews, because the young people really enjoyed it. They\\u2019d say things like, \\u201cOh my gosh, I said some good stuff in there. Can you send me the recording,\\u201d right? Because we\\u2019d record these interviews. We had others who would call us up and say, \\u201cDid you ever get a chance to transcribe that? Can you send me the transcription?\\u201d And we were like, \\u201cWow, we really seemed to be hitting a nerve.\\u201d We\\u2019d ask young people for 30 minutes of time and they\\u2019d be going an hour later, they\\u2019d still be talking. And so we wondered, is it possible that this interview-\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nIt sounds it might even have been a process of self-discovery or they realized things about themselves they hadn\\u2019t put into words before.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nExactly. Right. We just started to wonder, is it possible that this interview is a intervention? I mean, not an intentional one, but is it making a difference? And we had already planned to conduct a second round of survey research months later. At that time we did look at the young people who we had selected to participate in interviews. And we compared their purpose scores to the young people who had not participated in the interviews. And lo and behold, we found that those young people who participated in this one time, roughly 45 minute interview had significantly higher rates of purpose months later.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWe realized, yeah, this is so something that we can cultivate. In fact, we did it without meaning to. We also tried to be really reflective on, what\\u2019s going on in this interview that was so powerful? And so we deconstructed it and I think it was the opportunity to really reflect on a lot of times when we talk, this was research we did with young adults. Adolescents and young adults, and a lot of times in our conversations with adolescents and young adults, we ask much more about the here and now, what are you doing today?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nDid you get your homework done this week? What are you doing maybe next week? Or what college are you applying to next semester? But we don\\u2019t very often engage them in conversations about the long term, what do you really want out of your life? What do you hope to accomplish in your life? And why? Why is that really important to you? And I think those conversations really resonated with young people from a developmental perspective, we know that adolescents and young adults are really poised to be tackling these kinds of questions.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd so I think it was a really developmentally appropriate time to ask them these things and they enjoyed thinking about it and through the process of talking it all out and having us as the interviewers push them a little bit. They did come to some conclusions or at least start to come to some conclusions that were pretty meaningful to them.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah, that seems to probably be an important aspect of it, that it is an interview and it is someone who\\u2019s potentially willing to push you more than you might yourself in maybe doing some writing about it or thinking about it, or even talking with a friend.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nExactly.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nThat\\u2019s one of the important part.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWell, and I think one of the things we asked a lot in the interview was the why. You say you want to become a teacher, but why? Why is that important to you? And I remember this young woman in Indiana and she was saying, \\u201cWell, you know what? I don\\u2019t want to be one of those teachers that just clocks in and clocks out. I really want to be one of these teachers that makes a friends in her students lives.\\u201d\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd why, why we kept asking. And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cAs it turns out, my parents went through a bad divorce and I had a teacher who really reached out to me and this teacher was so wonderful and so helpful. And I\\u2019m just so grateful for all that she did for me, she was there for me at time when I really needed her and I want to be able to be there for my too and they\\u2019re going through tough times.\\u201d\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd so that\\u2019s the pushing that we would give, and I think that it\\u2019s easy to say, \\u201cOh, you want to be a teacher. Okay, great, done.\\u201d Right, but when you keep pushing, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat does matter to me? And might there be other ways in which I could achieve the same goal?\\u201d But the values, the things that you really value in your life, I think are really from the foundation of your purpose. And so that\\u2019s a lot of what we were getting at, was really trying to push young people to think seriously about what it is they value and what it is they care about.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nThat\\u2019s great. If you wanted to just choose a few, what are some of the other key findings that you\\u2019ve found, or that you\\u2019re in the process, or that you can talk about about human purpose? What are some of the essential aspects of it?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nDo you want to talk about the interventions that help people discover a purpose for their life, or just more the truths about the construct? Or both\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI\\u2019m interested in both. Maybe let\\u2019s do both, let\\u2019s do a little bit of both if we can.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWell, I do think one of the interesting things about purpose is, and I think this is a growing area of research, is the role in cycle in physical health, because it makes sense that leading a life of purpose would make you feel good and that it would help you feel this deep sense of contentedness that you know where you\\u2019re headed. But I think it\\u2019s really interesting is the role that it plays in physical health.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd of course, this makes sense, right? If your mental health is good, your physical health is going to be better. We know those two are not divorced from one another, they\\u2019re connected and they\\u2019re related to one another. But I think the research that really bears that out is pretty powerful, because sometimes it\\u2019s easy for people to sort of, \\u201cOh, this is all fine and well and touchy feely and all of that.\\u201d But until they see the physical health research and then they start to realize, \\u201cOh, okay, wait, this really does make a difference.\\u201d\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nIn terms of the intervention, we love the idea of the interview, but of course, the truth is, we can\\u2019t go around and interview all young people across the country and help them discover a purpose for their lives. One of the things that we did was we took the interview and we really tried to translate it into an online tool and we tried to recreate basically the experience of the interview in an online tool. And we tested each component of this tool separately, and then we rolled it all up and tested it together. And it turned out it was actually pretty effective.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWe have a bunch of activities that we have found through our research really do help young people reflect on what matters most to them. One of the activities is actually a is a video of Jimmy Fallon. He\\u2019s a late night talk show host, and he\\u2019s talking about how he fell. He tripped and he\\u2026 Well, he broke his finger, but it was worse than just a break. He was actually at risk of losing his finger. And so it was hospitalized for quite some time as they were dealing with this, going through surgeries and all this.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd somebody had brought him Victor Frankl\\u2019s book, Man\\u2019s Search for Meaning. And so he talks in this little three minute YouTube clip about what it means to have a purpose in life, and he talks about what his own purpose in life is. And he says, \\u201cBeing here in this hospital where everybody\\u2019s sad, down, this isn\\u2019t a really happy place to always be.\\u201d He said, \\u201cI realize my purpose is I make people laugh.\\u201d\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s a really fun clip because I think it\\u2019s one that young people can relate to. It\\u2019s only three minutes long, but it\\u2019s a good example of modeling, right? He\\u2019s really modeling his own purpose in life. And so we have young people watch the clip and then reflect on what is\\u2026 He talks about it as a gift? What is your gift? What are the special talents or skills that you have and how can you put them to work to make a difference in the world around you?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nOne of the other things that we do in this online, because I do think that human interaction is really key to cultivating purpose. And in an online setting, you don\\u2019t necessarily get that. We tried to build in experiences where students or the participants are forced to go interact with other people. One of the things we had them do was to think about the thing that mattered most to them and come up with some symbol for it.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nMaybe what really matters to you is preserving the environment. And so maybe the symbol would be a plant or an animal or something, or maybe what matters most to you is your religious faith. And so some symbol for that might be a cross or some other religious symbol. And the idea is that they would actually draw this symbol in as a form of a temporary tattoo on their body, somewhere that is visible to the outside world. And they\\u2019re supposed it around for at least a week.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd the idea behind that is that people see it and they ask them about it. And so it forces the person to have basically the same conversation where they\\u2019re explaining their purpose to other people around them. And we found that that was actually pretty powerful. It\\u2019s just somebody talked about wearing this symbol to a job interview and they had an opportunity in this job interview to really talk about something that mattered deeply to them. And the interviewer enjoyed it because they got to know them on a little deeper level in the interview. We had this opportunity to, again, reflect on what matters most to her and why.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nThat\\u2019s a really unique approach, you\\u2019re forcing-\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nCreative, right?\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nForcing an intervention in the world almost, or using someone\\u2019s everyday life in the interactions they have. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cNope, you\\u2019re going to talk about this, you\\u2019re going to return back to this.\\u201d\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nExactly. And we did another one along those same lines, where we had them send emails to three adults who know them well, so they could be coaches, teachers, mentors, family friends, they were supposed to be outside your immediate family though. And these adults were asked in just five minutes or less to answer three questions about the young person. What do you think I do particularly well? What do you think I really enjoy doing? And how do you think I\\u2019ll leave my mark on the world?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nAnd so the idea was that you\\u2019d say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t spend too much time thinking about this, I just want to know real quickly what you see?\\u201d But they\\u2019d get emails back from friends and family who know them well. And that could be really illuminating too. Sometimes you don\\u2019t know what your purpose is, but people around you might have a pretty good idea. And so we found that was really effective in helping people to reflect. Lots of activities and things that we\\u2019ve come up with to help people reflect on their purpose. And some of these do involve other people, some of them are more solitary.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nBut I think those are some great examples to give people an idea of what these interventions actually look like, because when you hear the word intervention, your mind might go all sorts of places, but these are super practical. As you said, some are probably self-reflective and others really are relational, but they\\u2019re the things that help you gain insights about yourself in ways that you probably want to do otherwise.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nYeah, I think that\\u2019s right. And most of them are pretty fun, they\\u2019re pretty non-threatening.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nYeah, exactly. Which is also perfect for the, well, for folks in general, but definitely for that age group too.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nRight, right, we want people to actually give them a try. We actually had this, there was an organization out of Berkeley, the Greater Good Science Center. And they had gotten a grant to try to get more of a national conversation going around purpose. I worked with them a little and encourage them to, they could approach it through a variety of different age groups. And I said, \\u201cGot to consider young people.\\u201d And I was lucky enough that they took our suggestion and in the end they actually decided to do a scholarship.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThey got money to offer up to $50,000 in college scholarships. And the idea was that the young people, they completed our online toolkit of purpose fostering activities. And then they\\u2019d write a purpose inspired college essay and essays were selected based on how purposeful they really were. And the winning essays were given up to $50,000 in college scholarships, which was fun. And it was neat for us, because like I said, historically a lot of this research that we\\u2019ve done has been put on the shelf and this was an opportunity to see our research being used and people benefiting from it, which was pretty inspiring.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI think it\\u2019s great. And I also think the focus on young folks is really important too. I mean, there\\u2019s plenty of research backing up how impactful that time of life is and forming identity.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThat\\u2019s right.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nAnd if you\\u2019re interjecting some work to really develop a more robust sense of purpose, or maybe one at all, the process of self-discovery. I think this is great work.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThank you.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nWrapping up, I just want to give you the opportunity. I mean, is there anything that you haven\\u2019t had a chance to say, any takeaways you\\u2019d to leave our listeners with about either the work you do or anything else that we\\u2019ve discussed today?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nGosh, I can\\u2019t think of anything really specific. I mean, I think that, if you\\u2019re interested in the work around positive psychology feel free to reach out, there are lots of resources online, and in books, and in podcasts and things that. But I think it\\u2019s a really inspiring topic to study, I think that the the things that we choose to dedicate our lives professionally from a career perspective, they do give us a lens through which we view the world. And I feel pretty fortunate to have this positive psychic lens that I view the world through. It\\u2019s an inspiring way to see the world.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nI mean our least education draws a distinction between a deficit model and a, I don\\u2019t want to say, an asset model. If I remember correctly, it seems to definitely lean more on the side of the asset model. Folks can find more of your work at Adolescent Moral Development Lab website, I\\u2019m sure.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nThat\\u2019s right.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nAnd maybe some of these, I don\\u2019t want to say tutorials, but these intervention tools that you\\u2019ve talked about, the online ones, would they be able to find more information about those on that website as well?\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nYes, they would. The actual online tool kits are available there for anybody to use for free.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nOkay, awesome. Great, Dr. Kendall Bronk, thank you so much for visiting the podcast today. I really appreciate it. And for giving us a bit more of an insight into psychology, but also significantly in the positive psychology in the work you\\u2019re doing around purpose. I really appreciate it.\\n\\nDr. Kendall Cotton Bronk:  \\nWell, thanks so much for having me. I\\u2019ve enjoyed having the opportunity to talk a little bit about the work.\\n\\nMarcus Weakley:  \\nFrom Studio B3 at Claremont Graduate University, this is Breaking the Shackles of Time.

Can they motivate you to stop smoking, persuade you to buy insurance, or convince you to conserve water when you shower? The answer is a resounding \\u201cyes\\u201d. Until recently, most software applications and technologies were developed without much thought to how they influenced their users. This perspective is changing. Today, industry experts and academics are embracing a purposeful approach to persuasive design. In an industry context, designing for persuasion is becoming essential for success. In academic settings, the study of persuasive technology illuminates the principles that influence and motivate people in different aspects of their lives. This course will bring together the latest research happening in three distinct disciplines: information and communication technology, psychology and health sciences. Persuasive technology may be defined as any interactive computing system designed to change people\\u2019s attitudes or behaviors. The emergence of the Internet has led to a proliferation of web sites designed to persuade or motivate people to change their attitudes and behavior. The auction site eBay has developed an online exchange system with enough credibility that users are persuaded to make financial transactions and to divulge personal information. Within the domain of mobile health, systems such as mobile applications for managing obesity and digital interventions to overcome addictive behaviors have demonstrated the huge potential of persuasive technologies for behavioral changes.\\n\\nThere is a vibrant community of trans-disciplinary researchers worldwide that have been actively advancing the field of persuasive technology. The annual conference Persuasive Technology is now in its 9th year and will be held next year in the city of Padua, Italy. Dr. Chatterjee is a prominent member of this community and was the host/organizer of the 4th International Conference on Persuasive technology that was held at Claremont in 2009.\\n\\nThis course will cover the necessary content through presentations, discussions, case studies and projects. Students will explore latest research results, best practices and guidelines for the use of persuasive applications.

Brandon details a bit about his intellectual biography as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, getting introduced to the writings of Hugh Nibley, learning to think critically and ask penetrating questions about his faith, and how that led him to study esoteric subjects such as Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, and theosophy under Jeffrey Kripal and Claire Fanger at Rice University. Now, Brandon is bringing these approaches to Mormon Studies in how Latter-day Saints experience their temple ordinances, in their ritual and mystical elements, through comparing them with Neoplatonic theurgy. Invoking the comparative hermeneutics of Algis Uzdavinys in his work Philosophy and Theurgy in Late Antiquity, Brandon explores how Mormonism\\u2019s temple practices can be categorized as \\u201ctheurgic\\u201d in nature, ritual actions that aid initiates to bring themselves into higher states of consciousness and align their actions with the actions of God.\\n\\nFor further information on theurgy and Mormonism, please check out the following titles:\\n\\n\\u201cPhilosophy and Theurgy in Late Antiquity\\u201d by Algis Uzdavynis\\n\\n\\u201cTheurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus\\u201d by Gregory Shaw\\n\\n\\u201cTemple and Cosmos: Beyond This Ignorant Present\\u201d by Hugh Nibley\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"The Analyst and the Fool: Brandon Wilson - Mormonism, Theurgy, and the Theurgic - CGU Podcasts\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/the-analyst-and-the-fool-brandon-wilson-mormonism-theurgy-and-the-theurgic/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: The Hunt, Oil Painting](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/110922newyork1.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/110922newyork1.jpg)  \\n_The Hunt, Oil Painting_\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** Unknown  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):** Painting  \\n**Object Material(s):** oil, paint  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Poland  \\n**Provenience Location:** 1944  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Spoils of war\\n\\n**Nation:** Poland\\n\\n**Location:** German troops confiscated the most valuable art pieces in the museums possession\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nOil Painting: Polish, The Hunt - The Hunt\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2006  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2011  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Litigation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Polish National Museum  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Poland  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Institution\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\\n\\nThough found at different auction houses in New York, this painting and the painting below it (\\\"Off to the Hunt\\\") were returned to Poland together.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"The Hunt, Oil Painting \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/the-hunt-oil-painting/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Breaking the Shackles of Time\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nWriting is one of the essential human activities, both historically and in all the contemporary ways it is still pervasive in our lives.

My parents grew up in Lebanon\\u2026. I was born in Libya. I lived there for about four years. We moved to Lebanon for about three or four years\\u2026. There was the civil war, and then we moved to Kuwait. And then when I was about twelve years old, we moved to the United States, to San Francisco\\u2026. My family has been Christian, I would say for centuries, on both sides of my family.\\n\\nSo we came in 1978, and in 1979 my parents bought their first home in Walnut Creek, in California. And we were assimilating to the American \\\\[way of life\\\\]\\u2026.

America was seen as sex, drugs, and rock and roll\\u2026.\\n\\nOnce \\\\[our neighbors\\\\] saw that we were kind of interested \\\\[in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\\\] they brought us to church with them. And so we started to go to church.\\u2026 They were super friendly. So that ward or that congregation just really took us in because they were just really nice people\\u2026. My parents got baptized\\u2026. I think being members of the Church helped us preserve some of the values that we had growing up that were very much part of our culture\\u2026 But I think for all of us, I would say for every single one of us, our relationship with God was better, it was more real. God became a more real person to us.\\n\\n\\\\[My husband and I\\\\] dated for about a year, and I wanted somebody to be open minded because my family\\u2019s Lebanese. We\\u2019re still \\u2026 not the typical American family. I\\u2019m like, is he going to like the food? Is he going to let me speak Arabic? Does he care that we are Lebanese? Or is he prejudiced against Arabs? You just don\\u2019t know when you come from another country how people might feel about your culture. What about his family? Are they prejudiced? I don\\u2019t know. But his family was lovely. I think on our third date I was like, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019re going to a Lebanese restaurant and there\\u2019s gonna be a belly dancer.\\u201d Because that\\u2019s the other part \\u2026 is he going to be really narrow minded, or is he somebody with an open spirit? He was having a great time\\u2026. And so that was really great. As I visited his family, family was really important to him too\\u2026. I wanted somebody whose family was important to them, because I wanted both of our families to be important to us. So we dated and a year later we did get married in the temple.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 2: Picture taken in Kuwait between 1975-1977](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/05/Kuwait-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nPicture taken in Kuwait between 1975-1977\\n\\n![Image 3: My family today](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/05/Lenning-Orange-7687-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nMy family today\\n\\n![Image 4: Baptism of a Family in 1989 in Caen, France while on mission.](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/05/Mission-Caen-Winter-1989.jpg)\\n\\nBaptism of a Family in 1989 in Caen, France while on mission.\\n\\n![Image 5: Wedding photo with my husband Grant](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/05/Wedding-Day-12.30.94-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nWedding photo with my husband Grant\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Natali Lenning - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/natali-lenning/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"_\\u201cIn practice, what matters is not whether the physician makes the right diagnosis but whether the patient recovers \\u2013 that\\u2019s performance, it\\u2019s a test\\u201d_ \\u00a0\\u2014 \\u00a0Peter F.

Known to many as the \\u201cfather of flow\\u201d\\u2014a term he coined to refer to the psychological state of optimal performance\\u2014Csikszentmihalyi was a researcher, educator, public speaker, and co-director of the university\\u2019s Quality of Life Research Center.\\n\\n### _**He devoted his life to finding an answer to a simple question: What constitutes a happy life?**_\\n\\nAffectionately known on the CGU campus as \\u201cMike C,\\u201d Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\\u2014with Professor Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania\\u2014saw something lacking in psychology\\u2019s areas of study. So they set out to develop a focus on happiness, well-being, and positivity with a goal to create a field focused on human well-being and the conditions that enable people to flourish and live satisfying lives.\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi\\u2019s work with Seligman was preceded by his growing international reputation as the author, in 1990, of _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience._ A bestseller translated into more than 20 languages, the book\\u2019s many admirers include business leaders, President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Dallas Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson who, following the team\\u2019s 1993 Super Bowl victory, said of _Flow_ that \\u201cmy team has won because of this book.\\u201d\\n\\n### **Ideas & Interests**\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi\\u2019s interest in what he later identified as\\u201cflow\\u201d started during his graduate years at the University of Chicago. He recalled in an interview how he would watch painters in their studios and how he was fascinated by their ability to forget everything while working. He was also surprised by what happened when they were done:\\n\\n**_They\\u2019d finish a work of art, and instead of enjoying it\\u2026they would put it against the wall and start a new painting. They weren\\u2019t really interested in the finished painting._**\\n\\nWhat these artists were after, Csikszentmihalyi realized, wasn\\u2019t the finished work itself but the experience of full immersion and absorption in the act of creation.\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi went on to study how people attained this state, and in his early work he focused on athletes and artists. He soon discovered that this quality he referred to as \\u201cflow\\u201d applied to people in many different pursuits, whether they were rock climbers, basketball and hockey players, dancers, composers, or chess masters.\\n\\n### **Publications & Awards**\\n\\nUnderlying much of Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s pioneering work was his innovative and groundbreaking use of pagers and questionnaires to produce a database based on people\\u2019s self-reports of their ordinary experiences.\\n\\nWhile _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience_\\u00a0became a bestseller in 1990 and presented his conclusions based on that database in a warm, humanistic prose style, his other books\\u2014_The Evolving Self_\\u00a0(1993),\\u00a0_Creativity_\\u00a0(1996), and\\u00a0_Good Business_\\u00a0(2003)\\u2014expanded on his theories in a variety of directions.\\n\\nBecause Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s approach generated a cross-section of daily experience, his analysis paid more attention to experiences of positive states\\u2013like enjoyment or creativity\\u2013than many of his predecessors. That work formed the theoretical background of his collaboration with Seligman.\\n\\nTogether, in 2000, they published an influential article in\\u00a0_American Psychologist_, the flagship journal of the American Psychological Association, that introduced the profession to positive psychology. That work was recognized with Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s appointment as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and his selection for the 2009 Clifton Strengths Prize and the 2011 Sz\\u00e9chenyi Prize.\\n\\nOther awards and distinctions include his receipt, in 2014, of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary.\\n\\nCsikszentmihalyi also has enjoyed a robust following online. Since the first appearance of his 2004 TED Talk, \\u201cFlow, the secret to happiness,\\u201d it has received some 6,693,254 views.\\n\\n### **Lessons & Legacy**\\n\\nWith his arrival at CGU in 1999, Csikszentmihalyi founded the Quality of Life Research Center (QLRC) with colleague and co-director Jeanne Nakamura.\\n\\nOne result of Csikszentmihalyi\\u2019s work with\\u00a0Seligman on positive psychology was to create several research centers across the country that would focus on the principles of this fledgling field. The goal was to help raise its visibility on university campuses. The QLRC was one of these.\\n\\n\\u201cI am constantly and keenly aware of what a unique and fulfilling privilege it has been to work with Mike in so many capacities here at CGU for the past two decades,\\u201d said Nakamura, who is an associate professor of psychology in the university\\u2019s Division of Behavioral & Organizational Sciences.\\n\\nFor Nakamura, Csikszentmihalyi was always giving with his time and support to anyone entering the QLRC offices on Dartmouth Avenue. He didn\\u2019t have to know them well; he was generous with friends and strangers alike.\\n\\nThat made a deep impression on students, Nakamura noted, and they appreciated \\u201cnot just Mike\\u2019s creativity, intellect, and wisdom but also his humor, warmth, and generosity\\u2014 he could be unstinting with his time and attention. Visitors to the QLRC were often awed by this.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the years, he continued his research and worked on books and articles. As a result, he has been cited often in many places, from the top journals of his discipline to the pages of\\u00a0_Forbes_\\u00a0and the\\u00a0_New York Times._\\n\\nDespite a considerable reputation, Csikszentmihalyi was deeply humble with a low-key style of presentation that put students and colleagues alike at ease.\\n\\nColleague Stewart Donaldson, with whom Csikszentmihalyi created the Positive Psychology program at CGU, has said that it was \\u201cone of Mike\\u2019s beliefs that his own pursuit of happiness shouldn\\u2019t interfere with other people\\u2019s pursuits to be happy.\\u201d\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi \\u00b7 The Father of Flow\", \"source\": \"http://www.cgu.edu/people/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"* * *\\n\\nTopic: Mathematics\\n------------------\\n\\n[Ellis Cumberbatch](https://flame.cgu.edu/ellis-cumberbatch/)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEllis Cumberbatch was instrumental in building mathematics at CGU and fostering collegiality and cooperation among the math programs of The Claremont Colleges.\\n\\n**2022 Spring**\\n\\n[Ballot Problems, Viruses, and the Challenge of Being First](https://flame.cgu.edu/ballot-problems-viruses-and-the-challenge-of-being-first/)\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA new fellowship supporting CGU\\u2019s math students honors a trailblazing mathematician whose research on some of today\\u2019s biggest challenges shows that she was far ahead of her time.\\n\\n**2022 Spring**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Mathematics \\u2014 Topics \\u2014 The Flame\", \"source\": \"https://flame.cgu.edu/topics/mathematics\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Request more information about the Drucker School of Management\\n\\nAdmissions Representatives\\n\\n*   #### [**Adriana Leake**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/adriana-leake/)\\n    \\n    Assistant Director of Admissions\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-3310\\n    \\n    E: [adriana.leake@cgu.edu](mailto:adriana.leake@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Management, MS in Finance, PhD in Management\\n    \\n*   #### [**Michael Mirabella**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/michael-mirabella/)\\n    \\n    Director of Recruitment for the Drucker School of Management\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-9049\\n    \\n    E: [michael.mirabella@cgu.edu](mailto:michael.mirabella@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Arts Management, MA in Management, MA in Leadership, MS in Finance, PhD in Executive Management, PhD in Management, SOAR\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Diversity Statement \\u00b7 Drucker School of Management\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/about/diversity-statement/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Year of Object(s) Creation:** late Joseon Period  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** South Korea  \\n**Provenience Location:** GyujanggaklibraryatChangdeokgungPalace  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Alleged looting\\n\\n**Nation:**\\n\\n**Location:** Imperial Household Agency\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nBook: Daejeon Hoetong - Copy of \\\"Daejeon Hoetong\\\"\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2011  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2011  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Private Negotiation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Government  \\n**Complainant Nation:** South Korea  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Government  \\n**Respondent Nation:** Japan  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Korean Daejeon Hoetong \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/daejeon-hoetong/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Claremont Graduate University is a private, not-for-profit institution located in Claremont, California.

Marshallese are those with ancestry to the indigenous Micronesian people of the Marshall Islands located in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands make up an area (43 miles) slightly larger than Washington D. C. (http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107767.html). Although Arkansas has the fastest growth of Marshallese residents in the United States (Williams and Hampton, 2005), Southern California is home to a large number of Marshallese as evidenced by community estimates of 500-700 Marshallese church members in Costa Mesa alone. Unfortunately, similar to the Marshall Islands (Katz et al., 2004), data on cancer risk and incidence specific to Marshallese residents living in the United States is difficult to find. Cancer was the second leading cause of death in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, with the top five sites including lung, cervix, liver, naso/oropharynx, and breast (Kroon et al., 2004). WINCART and its networking members are partnering with Marshallese community groups in Southern California to assess needs and promote health through cancer screenings, education, and research. However, there are cultural beliefs that may create barriers to health promotion, cancer screenings and education. For example, public discussion of reproductive health and the female body is not practiced among Marshallese women. Many do not seek health care unless they are pregnant, or they are in crisis, and illness is kept very private within the immediate family (Briand and Peters-Pak, 2010). A \\u201cpresent crisis-oriented healthcare\\u201d is common among the Marshallese community and it often impedes timely attention to necessary treatment (Choi, 2008)\\n\\nPacific Islander Health Partnership (PIHP): The Southern California Marshallese community includes the Unare Beim, Marshallese Christian Church, Jake Jebol Eo Club, other Marshallese church and community groups which are building their network capacity with groups who value autonomy. \\u00a0 PIHP sponsors health promotion activities at youth and community events, coordinates health screening activities and conducts breast and cervical cancer community participatory research.\\n\\nContact: Greta Briand, Program Manager  \\nPacific Islander Health Partnership \\u2013 Marshallese  \\n12900 Garden Grove Blvd., #214-A  \\nGarden Grove, CA 92843  \\nTel: (714) 968-1785  \\nEmail: [gbriand5@yahoo.com](mailto:gbriand5@yahoo.com)\\n\\n*   Briand, G. & Peters-Pak, R.

Here we are on Latinx in the Inland Empire. This morning we\\u2019re going to speak with Alexis Paul Monroy, who is currently a cultural studies doctoral student at Claremont Graduate University. He is a resident of National City, California. His work at CGU concentrates on the sights, sounds and transformational power of the street. As a lowrider, his goal is to spread a deeper consciousness and appreciation for street culture while amplifying the often-unheard voices which fill them. Alexis received his bachelor of arts in sociology from San Diego State University and a master of arts and cultural studies from Claremont Graduate University. Good morning, Alexis.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nGood morning, Eric Thomas. Thank you for having me. It\\u2019s a pleasure.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah. I got to know you in class last year in Dr. Poblete\\u2019s class, and I was really interested in your burgeoning master\\u2019s scholarship and research. And I know you\\u2019ve worked really hard on publishing scholarship around lowrider culture. So tell us, Alexis, what is lowrider culture?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nOh, I mean, well, in its simplest form, I mean, you can think about it as the car culture, it\\u2019s a form of American car culture but with a Latinx and a Chicanx flare. It\\u2019s a culture that takes things that are forgotten or thrown away, revamps it, brings new life into it. And so, it encompasses everything, encompasses the religious aspects of Mexican American life with the combination of Mesoamerican origins, it\\u2019s a culture that resist norms and push me back against white authority, but it\\u2019s a vibrant life, it\\u2019s full of color, and amusement, and wonderment, that\\u2019s how I see it.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nOh, most definitely. So let\\u2019s talk about a little bit of the history of it, and then let\\u2019s take it back to the context of National City lowrider culture today. So did lowrider culture begin in SoCal in the \\u201940s or how did it begin? Talk \\\\[crosstalk 00:02:38\\\\]-\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. I mean, the major kind of conception of lowriding, it gets its roots in Southern California, it\\u2019s car culture, post kind of World War II. What happens is, in general, the car in American culture has representing upward mobility, expansion, forward progress, it\\u2019s that American dream. And for immigrants as well, for Mexican Americans coming to this land or already part of this land of the United States adopt that as well, but they bring their flare and their expertise with them. So it\\u2019s kind of ironic, it\\u2019s like the World War II provided the skillset necessary for these cars to be built. You take these instruments of war and you make it into a different weapon of identity, pushing back against norms of invisibility.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nSo after the servicemen left World War II, they have the skillset of working on World War II bombers, the auto pool. And unfortunately, they couldn\\u2019t afford the cars coming off the assembly lines of Detroit. So what they do is they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019re going to take these old cars, these forgotten relics, and we\\u2019re going to revive and bring a new identity to them.\\u201d So they start backward engineering. Backyard engineering is pretty much what I call it, they kind of, \\u201cHow can we get these cars running? It\\u2019s not good just to have a car that runs, we want something with style and flare.\\u201d And so, they start experimenting and starting to realize that if you drop the cars down, there\\u2019s a different attitude, there\\u2019s a different mobility of the car.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd then, of course, the paint jobs was their way of kind of showing their identity, whether they\\u2019re marked with Mesoamerican iconography, to religious elements, or even a Mexican American war icons like Emiliano Zapata or Pancho Villa, it was a canvas for them to express their identity. And so, yeah, there is this kind of connotation that it comes from Southern California, but I mean, it has its roots in so many different places, whether it be the American ideology of the automobile to its roots in Mexico with the caballeros who used to adorn their saddles with silver engravings and parade the streets. These are relics that are carried on and moved on in different forms through culture.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nMm-hmm (affirmative), most definitely. I really liked how you spoke a lot about the significance and contribution by Mexican Americans and the Chicano culture. As someone who lives in the Inland Empire, there\\u2019s many, many lowrider communities. And one thing I\\u2019ve learned is that one of their taglines is low and slow. And I wanted to ask you, Alexis, let\\u2019s unpack that. I think there\\u2019s a lot to say there that touches on a lot of communities that we\\u2019d spoken about and what they\\u2019re trying to do when they\\u2019re doing that low and slow.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. So I mean, low and slow in its form, it\\u2019s a performance. It\\u2019s a performance of being seen. So first when they dropped the car, they saw that it became an exaggerated, just the optics of it. So when someone lowers their car, it creates a new line, it creates length of the car, the vehicle, you can see different aspect of it, but it\\u2019s an attitude, it\\u2019s a form of being seen. So when you\\u2019re doing that low and slow, it\\u2019s just how do we elongate this time? How do we elongate this act of lowriding?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s a contrast. So in Southern California, you can kind of had two scenes. You had the lowrider scene and you had the hot rod scene. So predominantly the hot rod scene is an Anglo kind of culture that wants to go fast, \\u201cWe want to go as quickly as possible, it\\u2019s all about speed.\\u201d Where the lowrider flips that axis. It\\u2019s not about going fast or going point A to point B, it\\u2019s how do we elongate this performance? I want to be seen. And it comes to a lot of different things. It comes from being in a culture where, especially in Los Angeles or even where I\\u2019m from in San Diego during the \\u201940s and \\u201950s is that invisibility where we\\u2019re supposed to be not seen. It\\u2019s that survival tactic, don\\u2019t be seen, don\\u2019t be heard, that\\u2019s how you\\u2019re going to get to the next day.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nWell, lowriding says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not invisible anymore. You\\u2019re going to have to see me. You\\u2019re going to have to deal with my bravado, and I\\u2019m going to be here, and I\\u2019m going to be occupying space and time.\\u201d So that lowriding low and slow is that occupation, it\\u2019s that retaking or reclaiming space and time. So it\\u2019s more than just actions, I think that\\u2019s what kind of drive me into researching lowriding. It\\u2019s like, you grow up around this aesthetic, and you grow around this culture, and you enjoy it as a youth.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd then when you get to kind of where I\\u2019m at now, and you start saying, \\u201cWell, what is it really doing? What does lowriding do? Why is it such a stigma criminalization? Why is it a criminal act in some aspects, because it\\u2019s in a lot of cities throughout California.\\u201d And you want to know what is it doing to authority? And I think the biggest thing is saying that we\\u2019re here and we\\u2019re not going anywhere. You\\u2019re going to see me; you\\u2019re going to have to deal with me. And I think that\\u2019s the big thing, it\\u2019s a disruptor of authority and of hegemony.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah. As someone who appreciates lowride culture and went to Berkeley during the 1990s, I was really informed, like most of us in the \\u201990s, by the West Coast hip hop, G-funk culture. Dre, Snoop Dogg, how they kind of featured that as part of kind of a music kind of vibe too and the relevance of street culture for a lot of us who want to be seen. And-\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. And I think the big thing too as well is that lowriding is not all just a Mexican American creation. It has its roots there, but it also expanded way beyond the Barrio. And I think too, we have to come to realization is that we, and when I say we, me, myself as Mexican American Chicano, that we occupy the same places and spaces as our black and African American brothers, we have the same obstacles. And so, a lot of things that draws to lowriding is because we\\u2019re occupying the same space in place, that we\\u2019re more connected that some people don\\u2019t want to express. And I think then that\\u2019s where you see the adoption and collaboration, if you will, of input.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think that\\u2019s a big thing too with hip hop, is hip hop car culture, even car culture in general, music has always been synonymous with car culture, especially within Southern California. We have these thorough ways that we can drive, and there\\u2019s always a soundtrack to this movement. And I think that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s always this combination. So whether we see Eazy-E or especially Ice Cube in these \\u201963 and \\u201964 Impalas because we\\u2019re inhabiting the same place and time.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah. It\\u2019s such a fascinating cultural studies project because you\\u2019re really looking at this intersection of human lives but at the power dynamics, how people are displaced but also recasting their culture, and rebranding, recreating, completely re-imagining the street, re-imagining cruising, and re-imagining low and slow. I think it\\u2019s really a fascinating example. And that\\u2019s why I really wanted to talk to you on our podcast, Alexis, because I feel like there\\u2019s so much that\\u2019s accessible to your research and scholarship and-\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. I mean, I try to look at things. For my instance, when I look at small practical things that we do every day, so like for me, lowriding wasn\\u2019t an everyday kind of staple, it was something we saw on the weekends and you say, \\u201cWell, what\\u2019s amazing about this?\\u201d But also, why is it being attacked by authority? Why is it criminalized? When I look at hip hop or even that dance, why was it so demonized? Why do we look at this musical expression and say it\\u2019s bad for society? Is it because it\\u2019s critiquing society? Is it critiquing authority? What is it actually doing?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think that in the street cultures, it definitely, you start seeing this dynamic, whether it\\u2019s from fashion, to music, to cars, or even game culture, if you want to look at it, why are these developing cultures, what are they doing and how are they interacting with societal norms and authority? I think for lowriding in general, for me, I saw it as a way of pushing back, of reclaiming, especially with the tensions in regards to Southern California, and Mexican American and settler kind of narratives, it\\u2019s like the erasure of history, and I see it through lowriding. It\\u2019s like, not only do we reclaim land, we use the cars, the canvases to document history that\\u2019s been erased.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nIt\\u2019s like, how can I look at an airbrush mural and learn more history on a car than I did in high school about Mexican American contributions in the United States to different histories that isn\\u2019t covered? And so you use every mode or medium that you have to display this history. And I think that\\u2019s the kind of the big thing for me was in my field of study, what I try to do is what are things that I can do to help amplify voices that are forgotten or overlooked? And I think a lot of times those are the voices of the most vulnerable communities, and that tends to be communities of color.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nAnd I love that because what you\\u2019re doing is your scholarship makes a lot of sense using this metaphor, looking at car culture as an extension, Mexican American or Chicano life in Southern California. And like you said, why when I Google, for example, Alexis, lowriders, the first question is, are lowriders illegal? And you said it, this idea of policing or dispossessing certain bodies from street culture from cruising. As someone who went to high school in San Diego, I\\u2019m very aware of the dynamics that happen between, let\\u2019s say, the coastal communities of San Diego and the Eastern communities of San Diego, and how they\\u2019re very, very different places based on histories of humans who are dispossessed.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. I talk about places. For me, it\\u2019s always been places. For me, growing up in the South Bay of San Diego, which is predominantly Mexican American, we have Filipino and African American communities, but we have this place, it\\u2019s Barrio Logan, Chicano Park, and you start seeing throughout history, we keep getting pushed or cut with expansion of upward mobility of this ideology of American exceptionalism. And so, we start seeing, how do we maneuver in these in this new age? And for me, it\\u2019s like you start looking at these aspects, why are we criminalized? And that\\u2019s the big thing. I think when I started looking at lowriding, especially within San Diego, there\\u2019s a predominant big strip, it\\u2019s called Highland in National City. It\\u2019s kind of like similar to Whittier here for LA, is that this is the place where majority of lowriders congregate and crews.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nGot it.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nWhen I grew up, I got the tail end of it, and then it started getting where they shut it down. So it was kind of like you can get your car impounded, you can be sentenced to jail for six months for lowriding, so it was always this thing where when lowrider is taking that actual action, when they go to the street, even to today, that\\u2019s why I still call an outlaw movement is that there\\u2019s not a guarantee you come back with your car, you\\u2019re going to get ticketed, you can get pulled over, you can lose your car. So you\\u2019re always taking that risk in continuing this culture or continuing this lineage of protest.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd so back in the day, in the \\u201970s, I was reading newspapers and news clippings from San Diego Union-Tribune, is that any given weekend, you can have 2000 lowriders occupy a five-mile strip in National City. And it\\u2019s like what it really tells you is, are they afraid of lowriders because of the disturbance they\\u2019re making with the disruption of traffic, or the white authority, are they really more concerned about that many brown bodies occupying the street? That coalition of mobility, I think that\\u2019s really what it starts coming at, is when you have that much power in mobilizing people onto a single avenue. I think it creates fear and I think that\\u2019s where the biggest thing is.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s a misconception, it\\u2019s like this is this community\\u2019s joy, that thorough way, that highway was our Sol Foro. This is where we used to come down to our meeting place. And I think those are carrying on from our traditions in the past. I think that\\u2019s really what lowriding kind of does, it carries on these lineages that are chipped away through laws and through pressures from authority.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nMost definitely. I see lowriders as like living exhibits. And for our audience, I\\u2019m looking at a map of Barrio Logan in San Diego. And I don\\u2019t know if a lot of people know where Barrio Logan is, but for all of us who are in San Diego, do you want to kind of paint a little picture of why, even if it\\u2019s on the water, that it is industrial. What does it mean to be a Chicano Park in San Diego?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. So I mean, Barrio Logan in general holds a spot. I think prior to the 5 Freeway and the Coronado Bridge, it was like the second largest Mexican American enclave in Southern California. And that\\u2019s big for San Diego saying that, \\\\[inaudible 00:19:29\\\\] California. So what ends up happening is the 5 Freeway comes through for expansion. This is that whole thing that always happens, that United States needs to be improving progress, but they choose certain neighborhoods to cut. So of course, Barrio Logan was one of neighborhoods that got cut by the 5 Freeway. And then later on, they created a bridge that connects downtown San Diego to Coronado Island, which is in San Diego Bay, and cuts again this community.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd when I say cut, I mean, you\\u2019re losing, I think it was like up to 2000 houses and businesses that were Mexicano. So when you\\u2019re losing that many houses and people in general, it creates this kind of rift in the community. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cMan, we found our place and even now, we don\\u2019t have a spot.\\u201d So we\\u2019re always in this movement of progress. And I think another thing too is they start moving residential zoning. So it\\u2019s becomes this mixed residential zoning which allows NASSCO and US\\u2026 the US Navy has their shipyards right there. So before, previous, and this is prior to, I think the \\u201940s, \\u201950s, the community had access to the water. Well, that gets blocked, you can\\u2019t have those luxuries.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd then also too, we need your zoning for\\u2026 I think they had a ship building, there was this kind of aluminum siding metal working there. So constantly, Barrio Logan in general has one of the worst air qualities in San Diego. And there\\u2019s studies showing about high spikes in asthma and other kinds of cancers, side effects from having that mixed residential and zoned. So what ends up kind of happening is divide of the 5 Freeway and the Coronado Bridge, there\\u2019s this bearing land underneath these overpasses.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nSo in the \\u201970s, the community kept asking for a park. \\u201cWe want to park. We want a place where we can reside.\\u201d And the government at first says, \\u201cYeah, we can give you the park.\\u201d And then all of a sudden, it kind of gets renamed, once again, another tree broken, another false promise and they want to build, it was a highway petrol substation in that spot. So the community said, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re done. We asked for a park, we wanted to place.\\u201d Just necessities of life, if we think about it. And so, what they did was they took it over. They took it over with the community themselves, young, old, and they occupied this land and he created a park, which is Chicano Park now. And occupied this place into where at least the government said, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019re done, we\\u2019ll move our substation, we\\u2019re not going to build it here. You can have this space.\\u201d\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nSo the community creates this, I like to call it, it\\u2019s a Sol Foro. It\\u2019s a place where I think not only Barrio Logan residents reside with, I think it\\u2019s a calling place for a lot of Mexican Americans in San Diego. What they did was they took these blades or these pillars that cut the community and then created these canvases, these outdoor murals of Mexican American life that brings the color because if you could think about it, these overpasses are these bland, gray muted colors that resemble a kind of, I would say, they\\u2019re symbols of trauma, of family members leaving, family members having to move, of forward progress cutting through a community, and then now being now a pillar of the community. They took those pillars and they flipped it. They flipped the narrative and they created a space for many Mexican Americans to come to.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think what\\u2019s the beauty about Chicano Park. It\\u2019s a lot of lowriders. National City, the Highland was the middle connecting avenue that connected South Bay to Chicano Park. And a lot of times, a lot of these cruises would end or start in Chicano Park, and they would use Highland as a way connecting to some of the southern communities of Southern California or San Diego, California like San Ysidro and Chula Vista. So it\\u2019s this meeting place, it\\u2019s where our Monarch butterflies come back to live.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah. And Alexis just said it, when you look at the map, you can see a beautiful area along the water and it\\u2019s completely carved out by the 5 Freeway, we have the 15 Freeway coming in as well as the Coronado Bridge. For example, that would not happen in beach cities like Solana Beach, La Jolla, Del Mar, communities just north of that because of a lot of situations that we\\u2019ve been talking about around the history of access.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think too, is that we have to look at is when we talk about Coronado, it\\u2019s a wealthy island. This is where millionaires have their homes, Seeley, California, it\\u2019s also the naval base. And prior to the creation of the Coronado Bridge, it\\u2019s like there was only two ways to get off the island, you take the ferry cross into downtown, or you have to take the Silver Strand and you have to go through Imperial Beach, which is a brown community. So it kind of comes and looks at a different way, there\\u2019s a bridge representing a place of connecting two communities or is it a bridge that overpasses or goes past the community that many of these wealthy choose to look past, or don\\u2019t want to acknowledge? I think that\\u2019s really what the bridge, to me, represents, is this affluent community that wants a little more convenience for themselves, and while not looking, and basically driving over a community they don\\u2019t want to be a part of to get to \\\\[crosstalk 00:25:57\\\\]-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah. And I would agree with that because as Coronado Bridge remember used to charge persons for crossing, and so they would actually make quite a profit. And as Alexis is talking about, that really is an exclusive community. Now, they no longer do that, but I would completely agree with you, it is erasing and displacing a population of people. And that\\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you about the lowrider culture that you\\u2019re studying because it really is a reflection of Chicano culture and history in San Diego around Barrio Logan, and the significance and importance to that, like you\\u2019re saying, it\\u2019s part of your culture.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. And I think that was the biggest thing for me. I think any grad student coming in and you\\u2019re trying to find your voice, you\\u2019re trying to find what interests you, I mean, I think that\\u2019s the hardest thing. You\\u2019re navigating grad school and it\\u2019s like you have to write these papers, but you\\u2019re like, \\u201cIf I\\u2019m spending all this time in research, what draws me to this research?\\u201d And I think for me it was, I started looking at lowriding as something I liked in the beginning, something I do, I am a lowrider, but I didn\\u2019t realize what it does in society. So I started getting into these classes and I started looking at my passion and my love at a different angle and a different viewpoint of knowledge that I was gaining. And you start realizing like, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s a lot of nuance in this culture.\\u201d\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think that\\u2019s one thing is describing it, it\\u2019s not a hobby, it\\u2019s a culture. And when you start looking at it as a culture, then you start realizing the nuances, and the intricacies in it, how does it evolve? Where does it come from? What is it doing in society? And I think that\\u2019s where I started getting hooked and I started realizing it. When I\\u2019m reading pieces like Stuart Hall or \\\\[Tree Low 00:28:07\\\\], and I start realizing, \\u201cWell, how\\u2019s it all? What is it really doing? How\\u2019s it pushing back against society?\\u201d And I think for me, that\\u2019s where I started realizing I can do something that I enjoy and love, and you look at it from a philosophical level from a different light, and different avenue, and elevator.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s not to say that lowriding is an elevator to begin with. I think in our communities, we look at it and we hold it in the high esteem, or high regard, but it\\u2019s branching that crossover. And academics are saying like, \\u201cHey, look at this culture, you guys are not noticing the beauty in it and the power in it.\\u201d And I think that\\u2019s what kind of gets me going when I start looking at or writing about lowriding. It\\u2019s like taking something I like and love and giving it some volume, I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nOh yeah. When you presented in our history class, it really like turned a light bulb on in my head because the way you were able to share with us in class, that it\\u2019s a way of life, it does not separate from you and your lived experience. And that\\u2019s what\\u2019s really exciting about, in my opinion, your scholarship because you nailed it on the head. That\\u2019s what you are doing here and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re all doing, is building on these cultural historians work and showcasing in our own way. For example, why lowrider culture is significant today, you\\u2019re able to contextualize it and I\\u2019m really interested in how you are analyzing it. So do you want to, I guess, add a little more?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. So I mean, I think for me, one of my classes, it\\u2019s like you have to\\u2026 One of the big pushbacks when I was at one of my classes was dig deeper, get past the color divide or the brown, white kind of pushback and go forth, what is lowriding doing? And start looking at critique or society, and you start looking at how systems of power are created, and then how lowriding in general interacts with those systems of power. What does it do? When I say decolonizing space and time, how does it? And I think when you brought up low and slow, that\\u2019s the performance, that\\u2019s the protest. It\\u2019s we live in that society, when brown bodies interact in space and time it creates a different narrative for certain individuals. And I think that\\u2019s the big thing in how does it do that?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd then when you start looking at the canvas, when we look at it and it is art, these cars and vehicles are pieces of art. So how does art critique society? And so, when I look at, especially in cultures or communities that don\\u2019t have much funding or money, you just start looking at agility and adaptability. And I think lowriding in general just is a great example of overcoming one\\u2019s opposition. You have an objective and it\\u2019s how do you get there? Well, ingenuity, start tinkering, start seeing different possibilities. And it\\u2019s when you start looking at alternate possibilities or alternate realities for certain things, then it creates a new kind of opportunity.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nSo when lowriding at first, low and slow, they used to put cement bricks in the back to drop the suspension. It would cut coils, it was rudimentary how to get the car lower. And I mean, I\\u2019m talking about this is in the \\u201940s and \\u201950s. And then all of a sudden you start getting laws, laws get passed and say, \\u201cHey, you can\\u2019t drive your car with a wheelbase under a certain level.\\u201d So then like, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m a lowrider, I\\u2019m still going to ride low. We got to figure out how to get past this, how to get past this ticketing, how to get past this police presence.\\u201d And so, these people that worked on the World War II bomber said, \\u201cYou know what, I think these hydraulic pumps of the World War II bombers that controlled their landing gear, will raise and lower the vehicle.\\u201d It was looking at things that are\\u2026 And this is surplus, this is trash, because that time, \\u201950s and \\u201960s, those are out of date, all those parts are just sitting in a junkyard. And they say, \\u201cYou know what, I think I can take this trash and create something new.\\u201d\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd so, you start seeing those possibilities, and that\\u2019s the beauty kind of lowriding, it\\u2019s creating something out of nothing or forgotten things I think, which is the biggest thing, creating something out of something that\\u2019s forgotten or overlooked. And I think for a lot of people of color, we tend to be overlooked in society. So I think that that\\u2019s just kind of a metaphor too in general, is that we\\u2019re always overcoming obstacles through our culture. And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing is why is culture always the thing that gets police so hardly. Whether it\\u2019s the ghost dance that was seen as a threat, talking about dancing.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nThat\\u2019s right.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\n\\u2026 Break dancing in New York at the time. Why are these elements of culture so fearful for authority? And even now we see it with taking away certain history out of textbooks or wanting to for certain communities and certain states, because it shows and it paints a different history and light of America. When I say America and I mean the United States, not America, the continent, but the United States, it shows a different light of it. And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing is when we\\u2019re preserving culture or highlighting culture, that\\u2019s forgotten, you start reshaping narratives. I mean, you reshape narratives is you create a new forward or new progress.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nAnd I think that\\u2019s something we share in common, Alexis, is I\\u2019m going to start with what you began with, which really is looking at brown bodies, like someone like myself, who\\u2019s Columbian and Latinx and yourself Chicana. And the work that we\\u2019re doing to really recast public histories, really celebrating the agility, and the craftsmanship, the skilled labor, the wisdom and magic of lowrider culture, that, as we can acknowledge, can be looked at in one very simple way. But when you contextualize it, thank you, Alexis, and create avenues for us to analyze it, then it really widens our understanding of Southern California. And it widens our view of the freeways, it widens our view of the parks on Sundays, it expands our understanding of how art is criticizing and critiquing society and why certain people are overlooked.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nAlexis, I had a moment on campus where a lot of my research is about the displacement of the brown body and I\\u2019m friends with many people on campus and all the staff. And I wanted to take a selfie with my friend, Maria, who works on campus, helping in the janitor department. And I wanted to take her selfie with her and she looked at me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cEric Thomas, won\\u2019t you be embarrassed?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cOh, no, I wouldn\\u2019t be embarrassed, but would you, would you mind?\\u201d And she said, \\u201cNo, not at all.\\u201d But Alexis, in that moment, I acknowledged another brown human being who felt displaced. Even with the amount of hard work and skilled labor, that she feels overlooked in ways.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, in general, I think sometimes, coming from this background, especially people of color in the service industries, we get overlooked, we\\u2019re invisible. It\\u2019s weird, even in the pandemic, when we started looking at who is essential and all of a sudden these bodies that we deemed to overlook are now essential, whether it\\u2019s the fast-food workers who are predominantly people of color, to the farmworkers that are picking the food that can be sold in the grocery stores, it\\u2019s like all of a sudden, now they\\u2019re essential, now you look at these bodies and for some people who have been invisible their whole life, it is a shock.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think too, for us, as we progress in academics and academia, we\\u2019re traversing in a world that hasn\\u2019t seen us or not as much of us and it can be a shock to the system. But I think also, we look at it and we say, \\u201cWe still have to acknowledge our brothers and sisters.\\u201d It\\u2019s like, we don\\u2019t go to \\\\[inaudible 00:38:06\\\\]\\u2026 If my whole thing was for self-improvement, and be like, \\u201cI want to be a professor, I want to do this, I want to have this lifestyle.\\u201d But it\\u2019s like, no, I mean, there\\u2019s a lot of people that have contributed to my success into the lot in life where I\\u2019m at now, whether it\\u2019s financial support from family and friends.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nI mean, I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing I\\u2019ve learned now when navigating this PhD life, is that it\\u2019s not just mine, it\\u2019s not just my accomplishment, solo, my accomplishment. It\\u2019s my brother helping me out, buying me stuff here and there, because you know how it is when you\\u2019re in grad school or especially in PhD departments, it\\u2019s like we\\u2019re not the most wealthy people, we\\u2019re kind of strapping it together and trying to get to this goal that we\\u2019re doing it for, especially for me, for the culture. I\\u2019m doing it for Chicano culture, for people of color that we\\u2019re trying to tip the balances of diversity in these upper echelons of higher education and it\\u2019s like you do have all these different people helping you.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think that\\u2019s the big thing. It\\u2019s like when you look at Maria, she\\u2019s an integral part of this academia that we just don\\u2019t get shined too, that we overlook or sometimes forget. And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing, is like for me, that\\u2019s what I look at when I\\u2019m doing my writing or when I\\u2019m trying to do\\u2026 My biggest things that I\\u2019m always trying to incorporate oral histories into my methodologies because you can only contextualize so much from an outsider\\u2019s point of view. And I think you need those voices of the community that was actually there. And especially of women of color, I think those are the voices that often, right now, are extremely overlooked and not giving their just praise, especially in lowriding culture. We look at it as a strictly male-dominated culture.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s like, what if I told you there was I do believe it was two or three all-female lowrider clubs in San Diego. What power does that bring, especially being a person of color, to be a woman, to take up space, what is that doing in society? What is that showing? That\\u2019s a fight on multiple levels and multiple fronts that just by the act of pure cruising on a Sunday afternoon, what are they really doing? And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing we have to look at is, especially as academics of color, is who we write for, what we write for? And I think that\\u2019s the big thing is keeping that in our voice, is not to forget where we come from and what inspires us. And I think that\\u2019s the biggest things we can do. I mean, that\\u2019s just something that I think should be something we keep in the back of our mind every time we write a piece or present somewhere.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nExactly, I\\u2019m constantly, Alexis, checking myself every 20 minutes, and you said it, for academics, like me and you, brown bodies, black bodies, Asian bodies, bodies who are minoritized, we are very aware who is on our side and in our corner. And it\\u2019s often women like Maria. And that we need to acknowledge how much they participate in our culture, in our success on campus and that, for a lot of us, when we look in Maria, we see ourselves. And that we don\\u2019t want to be overlooked and that we are not going to overlook those bodies on campus.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, I think, for me, it\\u2019s always-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nThere you go, that\\u2019s pushback, right?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nThat\\u2019s me pushing back, going, these are the bodies that are in my corner and on my team.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, and I think, it\\u2019s like when I see\\u2026 For me, my father was a building maintenance, they call them building maintenance engineer but basically he is a building maintenance for the Sheriff\\u2019s department in the county of San Diego. So when I go onto these campuses, I look at those individuals, those building maintenance, I see my dad. I see my father working in these establishments, providing sustenance to his family \\\\[inaudible 00:42:37\\\\], I see that and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019m not too far removed per se, from that lifestyle and from that.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I start seeing\\u2026 when you can start seeing your own self and your own reflection in the people around you. And I think that\\u2019s where you start being \\\\[inaudible 00:42:53\\\\], so it\\u2019s like when you see Maria, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cHey.\\u201d They may see other professors or they see other people and students, like I said, students walk by them, or professors or staff walk by them. So when you sit there and you say, \\u201cHey.\\u201d And you take that time to engage with them, it\\u2019s a new feeling and it\\u2019s also shown us like, \\u201cHey, we\\u2019re part of this community. You\\u2019re you are us, we are gente, that we\\u2019re here.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah, and for a lot of us, Alexis, like myself, we speak Spanish. And so, it\\u2019s empowering to have other people who value their culture, like Maria, who\\u2019s still are very in tune with her culture, and that she\\u2019s really not dispossessed in a lot of ways. And to bring back to that word, joy, that she brings joy to the campus and work. And that\\u2019s what kind of ties us back to the lowrider, that this is really about joy and that many people wouldn\\u2019t imagine that a Chicano woman would want to lowride, right?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nOh yeah.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nBut that\\u2019s her celebrating her culture and expressing who she is in many, many ways.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, and that brings me to one of the oral histories I did. I did an oral history of Chris Cano and she was one of the founding members of a female lowriding club called Ladies Pride.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nWow.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah. And just thinking about the name, Ladies Pride. And so, especially within lowriding culture, you have the plaque in the back of the car and it says Ladies Pride. This is a lady\\u2019s car and the power to, one, in dominant cultures and society saying\\u2026 Because this was in late \\u201970s, saying, one, for some people, women didn\\u2019t have vehicles. Because vehicles to some extent, we see an upward mobility, but it\\u2019s a sense of freedom. So for an individual, for Chris to have our own lowrider, occupy the street, organize to even have these clubs, there\\u2019s a lot of organization that goes involved into these clubs, they would do fundraisers like Toys for Tots, one of their members became a detective, a female detective in San Diego PD. So it was kind of like these women are strong ladies, that need to get their-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nIt\\u2019s a network, like a network, right?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, and they need to get their shine and their\\u2026 Because a lot of times when I get disheartened is when I read a lot of this history that\\u2019s written, it\\u2019s like, oh\\u2026 And there was female lowriders, but they just went and started families. And it\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, no, that\\u2019s not the whole story. If you can devote chapters about other clubs and the history of lowriding, but you can only give two or three pages of a blurb about the female lowrider clubs. And so I\\u2019m like, well, where\\u2019s the \\\\[inaudible 00:45:59\\\\] or the justice in that.\\u201d\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I think that\\u2019s the big thing that when I go in and I start doing these oral histories for women, these female lowriders, especially when you do oral histories, like you may want and just talk about lowriding, but you\\u2019re getting so much rich content about what it\\u2019s like to be a Chicana, navigating this world in the \\u201960s, and \\u201970s, or \\u201980s, depending on the timeframe. Or it was workplace, she used to work for a cannery and she was just like, \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t move up. It was just I couldn\\u2019t get up anywhere, they always want me in this one.\\u201d So she starts hitting the glass ceilings, you start hearing how proud she was when she was lowriding. She would tell me how, if she worked on a Friday night, or Friday, it would take her two hours because she wanted a cruise to get to her work and how her car was an extension of herself. So it\\u2019s kind of one of those things when you saw her a car, you saw her. It\\u2019s like having everything clean, presentable, crisp. These are powerful statements.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nAnd for me, it\\u2019s just fascinating because I\\u2019m looking forward to the future of lowriding. My nieces in San Diego, if I could write them a letter in five years, what would I say? What would I hope for them? And how could they build on that and celebrate their lives in lowrider culture in San Diego?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nI think for me, it\\u2019s to enjoy it. To get in there and see the history, be part of the history, be part of the change. I think that\\u2019s a misconception. So I think because a lot of these stories haven\\u2019t been told about all these female lowrider clubs, so a lot of those women that have wanted to be part of this culture. And it is a hard culture to break in sometimes. I\\u2019m not going to lie, you see some of the murals and they\\u2019re not necessarily inviting for women, especially in the day and age that we are now, but that we need to change, and I think the big change is having that female presence there. So to hold accountable their brothers and say, \\u201cHey, guys, we need to be more inviting.\\u201d But to occupy that space too is to say, \\u201cHey, we love cars just like you guys.\\u201d And get out there and enjoy it.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd I see it, I have one of my cousins, she has an El Camino and she\\u2019s out there. I\\u2019m starting to see more women lowriders, which is great, it shows a \\\\[inaudible 00:48:37\\\\]. And also too, is because these passions aren\\u2019t just relegated to the boys and men, I mean-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nMm-hmm (affirmative), exactly.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nWomen enjoy cars too, and enjoy this culture too, and they have so much input to give on this culture. And I see it as a new progressing, I think like culture in general, it evolves. And I think that\\u2019s the next evolution for me or I want to see it with lowriding is seeing this dominant female presence in it, to see that it\\u2019s all-inclusive, to have more voices. And I mean, if lowriders can go to Japan and have this great extension to Japan, where the Japanese communities out there are embracing Chicanx culture and lowriding, if lowriding can cross continents, we can have a space for female lowriders in there. And I think that\\u2019s the beauty, to see the different elements, to see the different styles that even brings to the cars, different colors and different murals and different ways of seeing how lowriding can be, it\\u2019s exciting.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah, I think \\\\[inaudible 00:49:46\\\\]. I\\u2019m very fascinated in how you\\u2019re uncovering the equity that is available to Chicanos, and Chicanas, and Mexican American people. But that it\\u2019s often siloed, like, \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s just about the brothers, it\\u2019s just about the guys.\\u201d Or the cholos or these misconceptions of brown, and Mexican, and Latinx bodies. But I\\u2019m really glad that you\\u2019re going to really build on this because I know, from my lived experience in San Diego, that there are so many women who participate in it and that no one has taken the time, as you\\u2019ve said, to rewrite that history, to collect that history and to put it in a context so that more people, like you said, can go to the library and go, \\u201cOh my gosh, no wonder I\\u2019m a lowrider. I\\u2019m building on this. This is part of my culture.\\u201d\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, and I think \\\\[crosstalk 00:50:58\\\\]-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nPart of my community and I should have pride.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, and I think the biggest thing for us as academics is in who and where we write for and what is our intentions. So for me, it\\u2019s like when I write pieces, do I write it for the ivory tower or do I write it for the community that I live in and serve? And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing for me, is finding those accessible avenues to share my work and show that I\\u2019m writing at this level as well, I\\u2019m writing in this academic level, but that it\\u2019s for these communities and it\\u2019s successful for these communities. So whether that\\u2019s kind of thinking about do I write the piece in a different magazine or do I have to present it in a journal? Can I write a piece that says\\u2026 And that\\u2019s my next kind of thing is, can I document lowrider history and say put it in a car magazine, so that different communities see our extension or our progress to the automotive industry.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nBecause it\\u2019s kind of like when you see hydraulics, hydraulic systems are now used in a lot of cars. Sports cars use hydraulic systems. So it\\u2019s kind of like, \\u201cWhere do they get that from?\\u201d \\u201cOh, you know what, it\\u2019s funny, it came out of the Barrio\\u201d And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing, is you start looking at these little pieces that have been used in different avenues, but you got to give them their just shine, and you have to give them their honor that they deserve. And it comes to us as academics it\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere do I present work?\\u201d And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing, where do present and whom do I present it for?\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah, I mean, I can already see it, Alexis, as you\\u2019re building on a dissertation for you. How would you apply a digital humanities, an omega exhibit? How could you incorporate your oral history into a digital platform, because so much of lowrider is very visual and artistic, and so I can definitely see how you\\u2019re cooking on all cylinders, right?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, definitely, I mean, I had that experience in the last-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nYeah, you want your scholarship to shine and-\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, I definitely had a last\\u2026 We had a group project and we did that. We wrote about lowriding, and I said to my group and I just said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s such a visual culture.\\u201d So writing a paper in black and white does not give it justice. And that\\u2019s when as a group, we decided to create kind of like a mock\\u2026 well, I won\\u2019t say mock it\\u2019s a kind of homage to Lowrider Magazine and we created our own magazine, a critique issue. And we started to make a magazine that looked at how lowrider critiqued society, and how it is an element for critique, but doing in a medium that lowriders would know. When you saw that Lowrider Magazine on a shelf, you would see that, you\\u2019d know that.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd so, one of the things too, I\\u2019m kind of grasping is I want to do these oral histories, but I also want to create an element. We live in the day and age where social media is so relevant, it\\u2019s how we engage and interact with people. So it\\u2019s creating kind of like an online platform, where we have the women lowriders shot how they want to be shot, taking advantage of how they want to be presented with their cars, with links to their oral histories. So I think that\\u2019s for me, that stance. Because I think so many times in lowriding is, we see the lowrider model and it\\u2019s kind of men telling you how women should interact with cars. And I think it\\u2019s a time where we start realizing women have a voice and they can show us how they want to be with their vehicles. And I think that\\u2019s a powerful statement and especially if you can link that to the oral histories. So I think that\\u2019s something I\\u2019m kind of delving with and seeing what I can do with \\\\[crosstalk 00:55:00\\\\]-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nThat is really exciting because I could see you also come collaborating with these women, so that let\\u2019s say you would curate a digital humanities archive. Imagine collaborating with these women on primary sources, secondary sources, like you said, being able to share clips of oral histories. I can see it already, Alexis, and I think it\\u2019s a really exciting project and I celebrate all of the work that you\\u2019ve accomplished. You\\u2019ve worked really hard. And I do want to have a follow-up on this, but I know we\\u2019re kind of getting towards an hour, so I wanted to thank you, Alexis. Is there anything else that you\\u2019re working on that you would like to talk about?\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nOh, yeah. Actually, I mean, just real quick, I know because we\\u2019re even pressed for time. I think one thing I\\u2019ve kind of started with my brother is a nonprofit that we\\u2019re looking to start is that, during this COVID time, so during this time of pandemic, access to the arts have become very strained. And so, my brother has actually with his abilities, he\\u2019s purchased pieces of art from Sim\\u00f3n Silva, which is an artist here in California, in that we kind of want to create these mobile art exhibits for the vulnerable communities to visit because if accessibility to museums are becoming stretched. Although we\\u2019re starting to create digital platforms, we\\u2019re assuming communities that are strapped for cash have access to internet and to these technology, we\\u2019re assuming that, and that\\u2019s not the case sometimes.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nSo I think is creating this high-level of art being shown in some of these communities that don\\u2019t have access to it, I think is something that me and my brother have been kind of pitching back and forth and trying to get and purchasing art as well from these up and coming artists and established artists, so we can have kind of a mobile gallery for vulnerable communities to come and visit.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nThat is really, really cool. I just Googled Sim\\u00f3n Silva, because I did not know him, and he\\u2019s from Mexicali, so kind of a border town in San Diego.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nYeah, and so \\\\[crosstalk 00:57:40\\\\]-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nIs there something you\\u2019re cooking on or can we follow you somewhere or-\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nNot yet, I mean, it\\u2019s in kind of the infancy pages. We purchased some art that we want to display. One\\u2019s actually low writer piece, it\\u2019s a Batman and Robin piece that\\u2019s in, I believe a 1960s Impala. But one thing we\\u2019re trying to get, was especially with CGU being open now is I think I\\u2019m trying to first see if we can start displaying them here at the university, that\\u2019s kind of our next step-\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nMost definitely.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nSo just to have it around and seeing that. And then the next is kind of getting going on with the nonprofit and writing our statements and stuff. Because I think the biggest thing right now is culture and the arts, creating an outlet and the ability to maneuver in some of these obstacles and times, it\\u2019s just that hope. And I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing, is that we need to foster the arts and we need to foster\\u2026 Definitely, for me, I found in cultural study, I pivoted from sociology to cultural studies, and you start seeing how culture helps a lot of oppressed societies. So I think for me, and I think sharing art is a big thing, I think fostering creativity, especially within the youth. And creativity can be used not only in art but in sciences, math. You still need to have that creative aspect when you\\u2019re delving in those subjects, and I think that\\u2019s the biggest thing is how do you create that or foster that mindset?\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nOh, most definitely. I really like that because that is what really lowride culture is about. Creativity, art, fostering, nurturing, caring for, celebrating, being low and slow.\\n\\nAlexis Paul Monroy:  \\nAnd it\\u2019s that perfect segue between art and engineering. We look at automotives and it\\u2019s a lot of engineering that goes on there, so it\\u2019s the combination of art and science, I think, is kind of what I look at lowriding, it\\u2019s that perfect combination.\\n\\nEric Thomas:  \\nWell, thank you so much, Alexis. You left us with so many questions and ideas. it\\u2019s going to be a really fantastic fall, I look forward to seeing you on campus.

First, it is about Mormons. We mean by that term not only the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but members of what scholars call the Mormon tradition\\u2014all of those churches that trace their origins to Joseph Smith\\u2019s revelations.\\n\\nSecond, it is about migration. Often, this word is used legally or technically, to refer to people who cross national borders, or move from one nation-state to another. But scholars also use it more broadly, as an aspect of the broader process of globalization. That process is itself hard to pin down, but here we use it to mean the fading of traditional political, social, and economic boundaries and the consequent rise of new networks that cross those old boundaries, economic, cultural, familial, and social networks.\\n\\nGlobalization has been happening for a long time, and we might trace it to the emergence of trans-Atlantic trade networks in the 1400s and 1500s. But it also has greatly accelerated in the last hundred years, as new communication, transportation and manufacturing technologies have made older nation-states less and less important. Instead, non-governmental organizations have emerged as increasingly powerful: corporations, cultural networks, and religions.\\n\\nIn this new context of globalization, migration takes on many meanings. Here we use it to describe relocation across a border of significance. That might be a traditional political border, but it might also mean cultural borders, economic borders, or social borders. It might mean physical movement, but it might also mean, for instance, educational achievement or religious conversion.\\n\\nScholars have described migration happening on three levels. The first, and most familiar to us, is migration as a personal experience. How might a single person\\u2019s journey across a border affect their lives, shape their identity, or destroy or generate social, cultural, political or economic networks? In particular, the Project is interested in how that journey shapes one\\u2019s religious identity. It explores how various types of migration\\u2014physical, religious, economic, social\\u2014influence each other: how, for instance, one\\u2019s conversion to a variety of Mormonism might inspire other forms of migration, or how a physical move might facilitate a religious transformation.\\n\\nThe second level of migration is collective. Diasporas, a community\\u2019s departure from its place of origin, is an example of collective migration. The Project is interested in the ways Mormonism has served as an identity that facilitates collective migrations.\\n\\nThe last level of migration is institutional\\u2014the process by which organizations like corporations or religious institutions cross political or cultural borders, and the adaptations these organizations consequently embrace.\\n\\nThe Project is particularly interested in the interaction between the first and third levels of migration. What might individual stories tell us about institutional adaption?\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Aspects of the Project\\n\\nThe Project embraces four different efforts.\\n\\nFirst, [the Migration Map](http://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/migration-map/) tells stories of various Mormon migrants. These are individuals who have crossed political, cultural, and economic borders, and whose Mormonism was in some way integral to those journeys. We tell their stories in a variety of ways: some are written, some recorded in audio or video interviews, and some through documents that illustrate their journeys. Through a presentation of a kaleidoscope of stories broader patterns emerge, and students of religion, migration, and globalization might see how the Mormon tradition in total is adapting to an age of globalization.\\n\\nSecond, [the Claremont Graduate University Oral History Projects](http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/search/collection/cms/searchterm/Claremont%20Mormon%20Women%20Oral%20History%20Collection/mode/exact) tell these stories in different ways. Transcripts of the Mormon Women\\u2019s Oral History Project and the Global Mormon Oral History project document the lived religion of Mormons all over the world, illustrating the different manifestations that the Mormon tradition embodies.\\n\\nThird, [the Mormonism and Migration Archives](http://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/archives/) contain a variety of digitized source material bearing on the Mormon tradition in the age of globalization, from the nineteenth century to the present.\\n\\nLast, [the Mormonism and Migration Introductory Essays](http://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/study-resources/) offers scholars and community members brief essays discussing the history, status, and future of the Mormon tradition in regions all over the globe. It also offers a guide to scholars seeking secondary and primary material as they begin research work on Mormonism outside the United States.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"What - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/what/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Loading Events](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/resources/images/tribe-loading.gif)\\n\\nRestorative Yoga + Sound Bath Sessions\\n\\nThe EmPOWER presents a Spring \\u201824 Restorative Yoga + Sound Bath series.

\"Conversion\\n----------\\n\\n[Volume: Conversion](https://www.mohr.de/en/book/conversion-9783161528545)\\n\\nAccording to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), religious conversion is a fundamental human right: \\u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion_; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance._\\u201d(Article 18) Not all religious persons, groups or traditions accept this. Some allow conversion only to their religion but deny it to their own members. Some distinguish between independent conversion, which they accept, and organized proselytism, to which they object. Some accept it as a fact which they regret, and others threaten converts with the death penalty for leaving the religion into which they were born.\\n\\nMoreover, conversion is not always understood in the same way. Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam differ not only in their attitudes towards conversion but understand different things by it. There are many kinds of conversion, including a variety of religious versions. Often they involve more than a simple change in one\\u2019s religious identity. For some, conversion always means adopting a (new) religious belief, while others include the rejection of religion for a secular world-view.\\n\\nThis conference seeks to explore the topic of conversion in philosophical and theological perspectives. Is there any one thing that is usually meant by conversion? What are the conceptual issues involved in arguing for or against conversion, in a particular case or in general? Is conversion primarily to be understood in terms of what a convert does, or rather as something he or she suffers? How do Jews, Christians or Muslims understand conversion, and what is their attitude towards it? What are the individual, communal, social, cultural, legal issues involved in conversion, and how are they related to the theological and philosophical issues? Are there criteria for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable, serious and questionable, legitimate and illegitimate conversions? Are there ends and means of conversion, which are acceptable, and others that are not? Is to encourage, entice or accept conversion compatible with the respect for other religions and traditions? Where is the line to be drawn between legitimate witnessing to one\\u2019s religious convictions and the improper intrusion into other peoples\\u2019 lives? How can the right of persons to express their views be proportioned to the rights of others not to be exposed to views which they do not wish to hear?\\n\\nPapers to be presented include the following:\\n\\n*   John Cottingham (Reading, UK): _Conversion, Self-Discovery, and Moral Change  \\n    _\\n*   William Abraham (SMU Perkins, Dallas): _Divine and Human Action in Conversion  \\n    _\\n*   Joseph Prabhu (Cal State University, Los Angeles): _Inter/Intra-Faith Dialogue and Conversion_\\n*   Anselm Min (CGU): _Conversion as Dialectic of Perspective and Reality  \\n    _\\n*   Heiko Schulz (Frankfurt/M.): _Conversion and Truth  \\n    _\\n*   Eleonore Stump (St. Louis): _Conversion, Atonement, and Love  \\n    _\\n*   Gary Gilbert (McKenna College, Claremont): _Why Conversion?

Most of our programs require writing or portfolio samples in addition to standard application materials. Please see specific instructions by department:\\n\\n**Cultural Studies/English/History/Philosophy/Religion**  \\nAll applicants are required to submit a writing sample of previous work in addition to the statement of purpose. You may submit samples of any length you feel indicate your writing ability, but please note that we will be unable to return any items submitted as part of your application (please, no books). Most applicants submit one or two scholarly papers or excerpts of around 10 to 15 pages. Writing samples should not exceed 30 pages.\\n\\n**Art**  \\nApplicants to the Art Department must electronically upload a portfolio of representative work for evaluation. Portfolios will be accepted only through the online service provided by SlideRoom:\\u00a0[www.claremont.slideroom.com](http://www.claremont.slideroom.com/). Portfolios should consist of 15 images of recent artwork that represent a cohesive body of work. Performance and/or video artists may submit work that is no longer than three minutes. Summary educational information, the names of your three references, and a copy of your one-page artist statement will also need to be provided with your SlideRoom portfolio submission.\\n\\nStatement of purpose: Provide a one-page artist statement (no longer than 500 words) in lieu of the two- to three-page statement of purpose.\\n\\nArt applicants are not required to submit GRE or GMAT scores.\\n\\n**Music**  \\nApplicants to degree programs in performance must audition as part of their application process. Auditions are scheduled after an application for admission has been submitted. Information on music auditions is provided on the program\\u2019s [application checklist.](https://www.cgu.edu/admissions/how-to-apply/application-checklist/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe most successful applicants are intelligent, passionate about their education, driven to excellence, and serious about becoming active contributors to the learning environment. Because the School of Arts & Humanities is interested in building a diverse, interdisciplinary community of scholars, we do not use a restrictive set of standards for admissions but rather seek to evaluate each applicant on his or her individual merit and specific profile of experiences and goals.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes. We offer sessions regularly throughout the year. If you can\\u2019t make one of those sessions, please contact our admissions staff ([admissions@cgu.edu](mailto:admissions@cgu.edu) or 909-607-7811) and we\\u2019ll be happy to set up a personal visit for you.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNo. Our students come to us with degrees in a variety of fields within the social sciences, humanities, and the arts as well as other academic backgrounds. Obviously, the greater the background you have in your chosen field of study, the better prepared you will be to complete the assigned work.\\n\\nMusic and Art applicants should have demonstrated ability in their medium or performance area and are required to submit supplemental information along with their application (see above for specific requirements).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNo. Every effort is made to review transcripts of previous academic work carefully and to consider the many factors that can affect the picture they present. We are aware of the differences that occur between one\\u2019s freshman and senior years and of the many outside factors that may impact a student\\u2019s academic performance. We do expect students to do well in their major, but we do not set a requisite grade point average. We take into consideration not merely the grades received but also the quality of the institution, the difficulty of courses taken, and the reputation of the professors with whom an individual studies.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes. The admissions committee is careful to weigh community and campus activities, as well as professional experience, when considering an applicant. While we are clearly an academic institution, we know that real-world experiences contribute significantly to a students\\u2019 education. We therefore respect the time, effort, and learning a student gains from work outside the classroom.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe School offers two courses abroad and an exchange program with the University of Zurich for Religion students. School of Arts & Humanities offers two classes abroad: a joint Cultural Studies/TNDY course with Bath Spa University in England and an archeological field methods REL/TNDY course in Akko, Israel. Course descriptions are below:\\n\\n**Heritage, Culture & Managing the Past in the Old World & the New  \\n**Summer EXCHANGE Course  \\nJoshua Goode\\n\\nThis course is a jointly taught, dual-campus class that examines heritage management of historical sites and museums in both Los Angeles and the Bath region. While in Los Angeles, students from Bath and CGU will explore important cultural heritage sites, including the Getty Villa, the Autry Museum of the American West, the Huntington Library, Watts Towers, and the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, among other sites to be determined. In Bath, the students will use the university as home base to explore the city, named a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1987, and its many museums and historical sites, including its complete Roman baths, One Royal Crescent House Museum, and the Jane Austen Center. Outside Bath, we will explore Oxford and London to talk with museum leaders and heritage management experts. Stonehenge and the Victoria and Albert Museum are planned as part of the itinerary outside of Bath.\\n\\nThe differences between the two locations will pose in very clear relief the different kinds of issues that face heritage management experts in both contexts. How do we protect and manage historical sites and collections? Where do we find funding for the arts and cultural patrimony in a complicated setting of public and increasingly private fund-raising? How do we convey and maintain the cultural significance of these sites to contemporary and future audiences? Particular focus will be placed on the structural and economic differences between the regions that define how the arts and heritage efforts are funded and how broader, more globalized forces will define civic and national commemoration and historical education efforts in the future.\\n\\n**Archaeological Field Methods  \\n**Tammi Schneider  \\nAkko, Israel\\n\\nThe main component of this course will be the actual work conducted in the field. Students will work in fields that are broken up into squares. Every student will be taught how to record the finds and eventually will be responsible for some of the recording. Recording methods include such things as taking levels; recording find spots; filling out tags for pottery buckets, soil samples, and special finds; photo records; balk drawing; making top plans; and recording pottery reads. All students will be responsible for pottery washing and will attend the pottery readings at which the pottery from their squares is analyzed. Every day there will be a tour of all of the fields and a presentation of the special finds discovered with a preliminary analysis. Each student will spend a minimum of one day at camp working on preservation of finds already discovered. Class will be taught in Akko, Israel, during the summer.\\n\\nThe Religion department has a partnership with the University of Zurich allowing exchange students from each of the institutions. The University of Zurich is one of the leading research universities in Europe and offers the widest range of study courses in Switzerland. It offers a unique opportunity to study Protestant theology in a place that has been a center of theological learning since the Reformation in the 16th century as well as philosophy of religion and comparative religion in a newly devised program of the cultural study of religion. Students studying in Zurich must be prepared to deal with instruction in German.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNo. At this time all classes offered by the School of Arts & Humanities are taken at CGU or\\u00a0at the campuses of the other\\u00a0Claremont Colleges.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe School of Arts & Humanities has a very limited number of research assistant (RA) and teaching assistant (TA) positions available for the simple reason that we educate only master\\u2019s and doctoral students. The RAs and TAs whom we do employ are selected directly by our faculty and receive compensation in the form of payment, rather than tuition reduction.\\u00a0As a general rule, the faculty selects continuing students for these positions. If you would like to be considered for either an RA or TA position, please tell your faculty advisor that you wish to be considered if such a position becomes available.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe School of Arts & Humanities does not have a typical student, which is part of what makes the school unique. Our students\\u2019 interests and backgrounds are extremely varied. We welcome and train artists, musicians, archivists, curators, historians, philosophers, writers, educators, and many others. What all our students share is intellectual curiosity and a commitment to their fields of study while embracing the breadth and interdisciplinarity encouraged in SAH.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe School of Arts & Humanities has a large network of alumni in diverse fields from professors at universities across the nation to local artists to administrators and educators at various for-profit and nonprofit organizations, such as New Balance and the Autry National Center.\\n\\n##### Art Department FAQ\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNo. The admission committee looks at all applicants with a variety of backgrounds.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nUpon the review of your transcripts, the Art department faculty may allow you to transfer a limited number of classes or credits.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nApplicants to the Art Department must electronically upload a portfolio of representative work for evaluation. Portfolios must be directly uploaded to the application after submission. Portfolios should consist of 15 images of recent artwork that represent a cohesive body of work.

Illicit stimulants are extremely habit-forming and hazardous, and use is linked to increases in HIV risk. Their use often portends an ominous future for youth who have progressed beyond gateway drugs to this hard-drug class. Yet, there is insufficient knowledge about the processes underlying the early development of this behavior and its likely risks. The proposed research focuses on several of the most promising processes consistently uncovered in multiple independent lines of basic research but not previously applied to adolescent stimulant use or HIV risk. Two sets of processes of focus are:\\n\\n1.  Spontaneous or implicit cognitive processes, which encode and activate learned associations promoting risk behavior; and\\n2.  Protective, specific executive functions that inhibit or at least dampen the effects of such associations on behavior.\\n\\nThese processes have been well researched in neuroscience, basic research on memory, and decision theory, and they have been increasingly applied to other drugs of abuse in a host of studies during the past several years. The present project offers a novel line of inquiry that not only studies the main effects of these processes on teenage stimulant use and HIV risk, but tests a new synergistic (interaction) model derived from recent dual-process models that receive converging support from basic research and several studies on other addictive behaviors. In addition to the advance of predictive models of risk behavior, dual-process models can help explain more specific patterns, for example:\\n\\n1.  Why do some youth progress from gateway illicit drugs (e.g., marijuana) to illicit stimulants, while others from the same at-risk population appear to be protected from this progression?\\n2.  What mediates habitual levels of risk behavior and strong predictive effects of previous drug habits?\\n3.  What processes supported by extensive basic research best predict growth in stimulant use and risky sexual tendencies?\\n4.  Which specific executive functions show the best protective effects on risk behaviors in at-risk adolescents?\\n\\nTo address these and other related questions, the project\\u2019s major study employs a three-wave, intensive longitudinal design using validated, primarily lab-based assessments across ages during which drug use progression to illicit stimulants and onset of hazardous sex are most likely in an at-risk teenage population. Despite this risk, the target population is quite amenable to mobile lab-based, computerized assessment and future intervention. The studied processes are relevant to future interventions, because they are sufficiently specific and have been delineated thoroughly in several independent lines of previous research. Thus, clear implications can emerge from the evaluation of the studied alternative models of risk behavior. The integration of validated lab-based methods and processes into an \\u201cindicated\\u201d population study of youth helps the project have potentially substantial implications for innovation in theories of drug use and HIV risk as well as future interventions that could target the studied processes.\\n\\nInvestigators\\n-------------\\n\\n![Image 1: Alan Stacy](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2016/11/stacy2.jpg)  \\n[**Alan Stacy, PhD**](http://www.cgu.edu/people/alan-stacy/)  \\nPrincipal Investigator  \\nEmail address: [alan.stacy@cgu.edu](mailto:alan.stacy@cgu.edu)\\n\\n![Image 2: Susan Ames](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2016/11/ames3.jpg)  \\n[**Susan L.

The PhD is awarded on the basis of the candidate\\u2019s achievement in these areas:\\n\\n*   *   Understanding of diversity and its implications for education\\n    *   Analysis and development of educational policy\\n    *   Expertise in systemic organizational change\\n    *   Application of theory and research-based knowledge to the transformation of communities\\n    *   Use of effective educational practices, including tools available through technology\\n    *   Contribution to the knowledge base in education\\n\\nThe student demonstrates these capabilities through coursework, qualifying exams, and completion of a dissertation under the supervision of a committee composed of faculty from both universities. Students complete a minimum of 24 units at San Diego State University and 24 units at Claremont Graduate University.\\n\\nThe program has been in existence since 1978, established under the leadership of Tomas Arciniega and Peggy Hawley at SDSU and Paul Albrecht, then dean of faculty at CGU. Since 1981, more than 190 education professionals have earned PhDs through the program, which offers the benefits of a large, comprehensive public university and a small private university within a transdisciplinary learning environment. Graduates are currently employed as school principals, superintendents and program directors, college and university faculty and administrators, educational specialists in private and public agencies, and consultants to schools and businesses.\\n\\n##### Program Highlights\\n\\n*   Both CGU and SDSU offer a broad range of doctoral seminars and other graduate courses in education and related fields. In consultation with faculty advisors from the two universities, students develop an individualized program of study appropriate to their particular interests and designed to support their development.\\n*   Faculty at SDSU and CGU bring diverse research and teaching interests to the study of democratic schooling, social justice, and diversity in education, with expertise in such areas as public policy, organizational theory and leadership, curriculum and instruction, bilingual and cross-cultural education, educational technology, and more.\\n*   Although full-time study is encouraged, most students in the program are working professionals. Full-time students can expect to complete the program in as little as three years; part-time study significantly extends the time for degree completion.\\n*   All applicants must have completed a master\\u2019s degree program prior to admission and reside in, or commit to relocating to, San Diego or Imperial counties.\\n*   Fall and spring classes at both schools are offered in the late afternoon and evening. A variety of courses are also available during the summer at CGU.

Drucker\\\\*\\n\\nInsights from our research and referred publications on dataspace issues of management importance.\\n\\n**From \\u2018Big Data\\u2019 to better data  \\n**Dataspace is fundamentally focused on delivering not just \\u2018Big Data\\u2019 but better data, specifically the right data with relevant information content and quality, and all in the right quantity. Peter Drucker\\u2019s metaphor, \\u201cdata is information\\u2019s ore,\\u201d illustrates the hierarchical progression from **raw data** to **refined data** for **information** extraction and, ultimately, **insightful knowledge**. In this analogy, raw data is akin to ore, undergoing processing to extract information. Analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) serve as tools for information extraction and insight generation. However, without the right information in the data, any tool, no matter how powerful, is rendered worthless. Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, exemplifies this principle: the quality of its outcomes is contingent on the quality of the data it has been trained on. Therefore, dataspace holds strategic importance, serving as a key lever at the inception of any analytics or AI food chain.\\n\\n**Dataspace  \\nDefinition:** \\u201cA dataspace is a peer-to-peer data communication system (think: phone system for data or data dial-tone network) and not a storage solution, which sits on top of cloud platforms, with the advantage of cross-organizational data sharing with built-in data sovereignty protection: two parties who may not trust each other fully can trust a data transaction, because a data provider retains power to control rights to its data at all times through (a) verified authentication of users (who is involved?), (b) access control (who can see data offer?), and (c) usage policies, which are specified by the provider and need to be accepted and signed by the consumer (what is allowed?)\\u201d (see Schlueter Langdon & Schweichhart 2022). It resembles a \\u201ccontainer shipping system\\u201d for data. A container protects what is inside and works everywhere, on sea and land, and ports around the world. What you place in it and to whom you send it for what purpose is between you and the receiver.\\n\\n*   Dataspace **Top 10** characteristics, 2-pager: [Link](https://cdn.dih.telekom.com/1bb8e326-82d3-4633-936b-0dba005bf956)\\n*   Discussion of definitions of \\u201cdataspace\\u201d and \\u201cdata sovereignty\\u201d: Schlueter Langdon, C. 2020.

Central to this concept is the recognition that value creation is not achievable in isolation, and the outcomes can be synergistic, surpassing the sum of its parts (1 + 1 = 3) (see \\u201c[Biz Ecosystems 2.0: Built on Data](https://research.cgu.edu/drucker-customer-lab/biz-ecosystems-2-0-built-on-data/)\\u201c)\\n\\n**Case studies**\\n\\n*   **Industry & mobility** (including Umati \\u2013 Universal machine technology interface, [link](https://umati.org/)): Schlueter Langdon, C., and K.

A dataspace, in this context, emerges as a valuable resource, supplying both novel raw data and data products or refined data tailored to a specific application. For example, a data consumer (e.g., a supply chain software app like product carbon footprint or CO2 tracking) could pull data on-demand and near just-in-time from a data provider for a specific data product, a digital twin, for example.\\n2.  **Data provider**: Participants may provide their own data product or be asked to provide values for the variables of a data product template, such as a digital twin (a tier 1 supplier providing values for an OEM customer\\u2019s vehicle digital twin, for example). Merriam-Webster defines \\u201cproduct\\u201d as something that \\u201cis marketed or sold as a commodity\\u201d and which is \\u201csubject to ready exchange or exploitation within a market\\u201d. Therefore, a data product is like a food product defined by its information content (food ingredients), quality (nutritional value) and quantity, and ready to use for many software applications (recipes) (see Schlueter Langdon & Sikora 2020).\\n3.  **App developer** \\u2013 \\u201cthere\\u2019s an app for that\\u201d: New data, some of it available for the first time, will spark a rich application ecosystem, something witnessed before, for example, with the emergence of smart phones and social media. In addition, existing apps, such as a company\\u2019s capacity management system, may need to be updated in order to benefit from the better data provided in a dataspace. Our \\u2018Case study: RealLab Hamburg\\u2019 (in \\u2018Use cases\\u2019 below) exemplifies the necessity of adapting current applications to harness the advantages of better data available from connectivity with a dataspace.\\n\\n**Dataspace technology & interoperability**\\n\\n*   Staebler, M., F.

Consider giving us [real estate](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/#realestatedefinition-flyover). Such a generous gift helps us continue our work for years to come. And a gift of real estate also helps you. When you give us [appreciated property](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/#appreciateddefinition-flyover) you have held longer than one year, you qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction. This eliminates [capital gains tax](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/#capitalgainstaxdefinition-flyover). And you no longer have to deal with that property's maintenance costs, property taxes or insurance.\\n\\nAnother benefit: You don't have to hassle with selling the real estate. You can deed the property directly to CGU or ask your attorney to add a few sentences in your will or trust agreement.\\n\\n### Ways to Give Real Estate\\n\\nYou can give real estate to CGU in the following ways:\\n\\nAn outright gift+\\n\\nWhen you make a gift today of real estate you have owned longer than one year, you qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction equal to the property's full fair market value. This deduction lets you reduce the cost of making the gift and frees cash that otherwise would have been used to pay taxes. By donating the property to us, you also eliminate capital gains tax on its appreciation.\\n\\n[See My Benefits](https://web.giftillustrator.com/Calculator/Production/og.html?orgId=a0020282)\\n\\nA gift in your will or living trust+\\n\\n[A gift of real estate through your will or living trust](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/wills-and-living-trusts) allows you the flexibility to change your mind and the potential to support our work with a larger gift than you could during your lifetime. In as little as one sentence or two, you can ensure that your support for CGU continues after your lifetime.\\n\\nA retained life estate+\\n\\nPerhaps you like the tax advantages a gift of real estate to our organization would offer, but you want to continue living in your personal residence for your lifetime. You can transfer your personal residence or farm to CGU but keep the right to occupy (or rent out) the home for the rest of your life. You continue to pay real estate taxes, maintenance fees and insurance on the property. Even though CGU would not actually take possession of the residence until after your lifetime, since your gift cannot be revoked, you qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction for a portion of your home's value.\\n\\n[See My Benefits](https://web.giftillustrator.com/Calculator/Production/rle.html?orgId=a0020282)\\n\\nA deferred charitable gift annuity+\\n\\nAre you tired of the hassles of maintaining your property such as paying taxes, utilities and repair bills? Consider donating the property to CGU in exchange for reliable payments for life for you (and someone else, if you choose). When you arrange a [charitable gift annuity](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-gift-annuities), you receive a federal income tax charitable deduction in the year you set up the gift annuity when you itemize on your taxes. If you use appreciated real estate to make a gift, you can usually eliminate capital gains tax on a portion of the gift and spread the rest of the gain over your life expectancy. A gift of unmortgaged property to fund a deferred gift annuity is preferable and generates the greatest tax benefit.\\n\\n[See My Benefits](https://web.giftillustrator.com/Calculator/Production/dcga.html?orgId=a0020282)\\n\\nA bargain sale+\\n\\nWant to sell us your property for less than the fair market value? A \\\"bargain sale\\\" may be the answer. When you make a bargain sale, you sell your property to our organization for less than what it's worth. The difference between the actual value and the sale price is considered a gift to us. A bargain sale can be an effective way to dispose of property that has increased in value, and it is the only gift vehicle that can give you a lump sum of cash and a charitable deduction (when you itemize) at the same time.\\n\\n[See My Benefits](https://web.giftillustrator.com/Calculator/Production/bs.html?orgId=a0020282)\\n\\nA charitable remainder unitrust+\\n\\nYou can contribute any type of appreciated real estate you've owned for more than one year, provided it's unmortgaged, in exchange for an income stream for life or a term of up to 20 years. The donated property may be a residence (a personal residence must be vacant upon contribution), undeveloped land, a farm or commercial property. Real estate works well with only certain variations of [charitable remainder trusts](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-remainder-trusts). Your estate planning attorney, who will draft your trust, can give you more details.\\n\\n[See My Benefits](https://web.giftillustrator.com/Calculator/Production/crut.html?orgId=a0020282)\\n\\nA charitable lead trust+\\n\\nThis gift can be a wonderful way for you to benefit CGU and simultaneously transfer appreciated real estate to your family tax-free. You should consider funding the [charitable lead trust](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-lead-trusts) with real estate that is income-producing and expected to increase in value over the term of the trust.\\n\\nA memorial or endowed gift+\\n\\nA gift of real estate may be a perfect way to honor your loved one in perpetuity. When you make an [endowed gift](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/endowed-gifts) of real estate, your contribution is invested with and becomes part of our endowment. An annual distribution is made for the purpose you designate. Because the principal remains intact, the fund will generate support in perpetuity.\\n\\nA donor advised fund+\\n\\nWhen you transfer real estate to your [donor advised fund](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/donor-advised-funds), you avoid capital gains taxes and qualify for a federal income tax deduction based on the fair market value of the property when you itemize on your taxes.\\n\\n### Imagine the Following Scenario\\n\\n![Image 1: Woman smiling](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/stelter/case-study-donors/remainder-trusts-03.jpg)\\n\\nYou purchased a rental property years ago and have watched it grow steadily in value. Still active in your career and traveling frequently, you\\u2019re beginning to find management of the property more and more of a hassle. At this stage of your life, you have decided to move to a 55+ condominium development, where all exterior maintenance is provided and you don\\u2019t have to worry about security issues. You see this as an opportunity to give your rental property to a charity that's important to you while realizing valuable tax benefits.\\n\\nYou avoid capital gains tax on the appreciation and qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction of $250,000, which is the property's fair market value today. You are able to claim 30% of your $200,000 adjusted gross income, or $60,000, in the year of the gift. In the five years following, you can continue to use up the remaining $190,000 deduction. You are happy in your new condo and love knowing that the gift of your property will make a big difference supporting our mission.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n1.

If an extension is needed, please complete and submit an Extension of Time for Degree Request form (downloadable from the CGU website) accompanied by a proposed plan of study/research. The request for extension should be submitted by the program coordinator to the Registrar\\u2019s Office and must be evaluated and approved by a faculty advisor.\\n\\nPhD students can typically finish in five years and have seven years to complete the degree from the date of their first registration. If an extension is needed, students must submit an Extension of Time for Degree Request form. Permission for extension of time may be obtained from the dissertation chair and processed through the department.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nPhD students may obtain a master\\u2019s degree while concurrently working toward their PhD, provided they meet the unit requirement. Students may transfer up to 10 units for the 48-unit degree and 6 units for the 36-unit degree, following the procedures listed here. Students must have a B (3.0) GPA in courses applied toward the MA degree. Students may receive only one MA en route to the PhD.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMA students may petition to transfer up to 10 semester units into a 48-unit master\\u2019s degree program and 6 units into a 36-unit master\\u2019s degree program. Students intending to transfer units that count toward general degree requirements must consult with their advisor to determine the appropriate entrance point for sequential courses. Successful completion of an advanced course presumes demonstrated competence in earlier sequential courses. Formal transfer of units requires the submission of a transcript to the faculty advisor, who will determine which courses are appropriate for transfer. Student must have earned the equivalent of a B or better in a graduate-level course in order to transfer units from another institution.\\n\\nPhD students may petition to transfer up to 24 semester units into a doctoral program from another graduate institution. We recommend that core courses (in particular those covered by the qualifying exams) be taken at CGU. Core course transfer may require that the student take an exam to show competence. Only a subset of core courses can be waived. Non-core course transfer can be done after completing at least one year\\u2019s coursework. Students intending to transfer units that count toward general degree requirements must consult with the faculty advisor to determine the appropriate entrance point for sequential courses. Students who transfer from an MA program in the department to a doctoral program will retain all of their previously earned CGU credit.\\n\\nWe strongly encourage students to discuss their plans to transfer credits with their advisor.\\n\\nA formal transfer of units is processed by obtaining a Transfer of Credit Form, which can be downloaded from the CGU website. The completed form must be submitted with a transcript to the student\\u2019s faculty advisor for review and approval. In order to transfer units from another institution, students must have earned the equivalent of a B or better in a graduate-level course. Normally, final decisions regarding transfer units are made after students have been in the program for one to two years. This allows faculty to review student performance and develop a clearer understanding as to whether the transfer units are roughly equivalent to courses offered in the department.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nDoctoral students are required to complete a [transdisciplinary T-Course](https://www.cgu.edu/why-cgu/transdisciplinary-studies/courses/). This course is an advanced intensive experience that prepares doctoral students for high-level discourse, research, and inquiry and provides practical experience working with colleagues in different fields. The course counts as 4 of the regular 72 units toward the student\\u2019s degree. It will not add any additional units to the student\\u2019s degree requirements and will not count against the total number of transfer units from previous graduate coursework.\\n\\nMaster\\u2019s students may enroll in T-Courses, space permitting.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBoth MA and PhD students are allowed to take up to two independent study courses during their academic program, which must be approved by their faculty advisor and department chair.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes. Fellowships in the Division of Politics & Economics are merit based. Some students may also be considered for paid research and teaching assistantships based on excellent performance in research or classroom settings.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes. Excellent performance in class usually results in an increase in your fellowship. Under-performing students may see their support diminish.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nDPE provides students an opportunity to request an increase in their financial aid award, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships through the Fellowship Renewal Request Form, which is made available to students via email during the spring semester.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStudents can request to become TAs or RAs through the request for financial aid form distributed by the budget coordinator in the spring semester of each year. Faculty members make their selection once a year at the end of the spring term. We advise students to approach and get to know faculty members during their first year.

Samoans are those with ancestry to the indigenous people of American or Western Samoa, which are islands located in the south Pacific about half way between Hawaii and New Zealand. According to the 2000 census, there were 91,029 Samoans living in the United States and 49,804 Samoans in California, and over 60% (31,076) living in Southern California. A considerable percentage (20%) falls under the federal poverty line compared with 8% of whites. Twenty-two percent of Samoans possess less than a high school degree, and only 10% have earned a college degree (APALC, 2005). Seventeen per cent have limited English proficiency, and 6% are linguistically isolated (with no one over the age of 14 in their household speaking proficient English).\\n\\nObesity is of considerable concern for Samoans; one study of four islands with differing degrees of Westernization found overweight prevalence ranging from 33% to 75% in males, and 46% to 80% in females (McGarvey, 1991). Rates of prostate cancer among native Hawaiians and Samoans rose from 140 to 175 per 100,000 during the 1990s then remained steady through 2006. Rates of uterine cancer among native Hawaiians and Samoans spiked from 30 to 90 per 100,000 in the 1990s then dropped to 60 in 2001-2006 (L. A. Cancer Surveillance Program, 2009). Breast cancer is the leading site for cancer among Samoan women in California, comprising 26.8% of cancer cases, (Mishra et al., 1996) and Samoans experience significant barriers to both early detection and follow-up. Breast cancer screening rates among Samoan women living in Los Angeles are below the Healthy People 2010 guidelines (Healthy People 2010). For instance, studies of Samoan women in Hawaii and California found that only 33% had ever received a mammogram and 63% a Pap smear (Mishra et al., 1998; Mishra et al., 2001). In a study by Mishra et al. (2001) cultural beliefs among Samoans living in Los Angeles, Honolulu and American Samoa, revealed that cancer and prevention (including cancer prevention) were absent from the Samoan culture. An earlier survey study of Samoans living in Los Angeles, Hawaii, and American Samoa revealed that cancer might be a divine punishment, and that a traditional healer can cure cancer (Mishra, et al., 2000).\\n\\nIn September of 2013, the Cancer Prevention Institute of California published cancer incidence trends among Samoans between the years of 1990 and 2008.\\n\\nThe five most commonly diagnosed cancers among Samoan males were prostate, lung, colon/rectum, liver and stomach. Annual rates of lung and liver cancer decreased by 1.3 and 1.0, respectively. Notable trends include prostate cancer increasing steadily by 0.9 percent annually and a significant improvement observed in stomach cancer diagnoses with a 9.8 percent decrease. Meanwhile, colon/rectum rates remained stable over the 19-year period.\\n\\nThe five most commonly diagnosed cancers among Samoan females were breast, uterine corpus, lung, colon/rectum, and stomach. Observed trends include an increase in breast, uterine corpus, and colon/rectum cancer rates by 2.7, 7.3, and 5.7 percent, respectively. In contrast, lung cancer rates decreased by 1.5 percent each year and stomach cancer rates by 6.7 percent.\\n\\n| Cancer Incidence Rate Percent Change  \\n(% per Year)\\n |\\n| --- |\\n| Samoan | Male | Female |\\n| Prostate | +0.9%\\n\\n |  |\\n| Lung | \\\\-1.3%\\n\\n | \\\\-1.5%\\n\\n |\\n| Colon/rectum | No change\\n\\n | +5.7%\\n\\n |\\n| Liver | \\\\-1.0%\\n\\n |  |\\n| Stomach | \\\\-9.8%\\n\\n | \\\\-6.7%\\n\\n |\\n| Breast |  | +2.7%\\n\\n |\\n\\nSource: [CPIC Samoan Cancer Factsheet](http://www.cpic.org/files/PDF/Cancer_Registry/Fact_Sheets/Samoans_American_Cancer_Fact_Sheet.pdf)\\n\\nSamoan National Nurses Association (SNNA) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization founded in 1996 by a committed group of professionals serving the Samoan community across the country to improve and expand the community\\u2019s opportunities through service, education, advocacy, organizing, and research.

It is, therefore, difficult to identify trends \\u2013 e.g., numbers of cases; claimant and respondent nations; factual and legal bases of cases, means of resolution, etc. \\u2013 that should inform understanding of the growing political dimension of this area. Accordingly, the primary purpose of the [Case Index](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/home/database/) is to provide information to support more informed commentary on both high-level trends, and also individual cases, relating to disputes over ownership and possession of cultural artifacts.\\n\\nThe greater the number of cases documented in the Case Index, the greater the legitimacy of inferences, trends, projections, etc. based on the Index data. Accordingly, at this early stage of the project, our primary goal is to document the greatest number of disputes as swiftly as possible. Given this goal, and modest financial resources, readers should be aware that many of the existing case records are incomplete and/or unpolished. Capitalizing upon the flexibility of a digital format, we will not only continue to add cases not yet documented, but also will edit and amplify existing records. Of course we welcome suggestions and documentation readers are willing to share.\\n\\nThe CPDR provides non-partisan information, with the objective to inform all perspectives on cultural property cases, past and current. Partisan and personal views may be expressed in commentary that readers are encouraged to submit, and respond to, on the CPDR blog.\\n\\nWe believe that the availability of the information collected, analyzed and presented in this project will be useful to academics in law and other disciplines who study these cases, and also to journalists and other writers whose commentary may more immediately affect public opinion on possession and ownership of cultural property.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nAn administrator at a small museum facing a repatriation inquiry or claim from a foreign government might, for instance, benefit from consulting terms of agreements forged by larger museums that have previously dealt with similar demands involving similar objects.\\n\\nA law academic might wish to determine why a disproportionate number of cultural property cases are prosecuted outside national court systems, and examine the underlying reasons for, and efficacy of, this phenomenon.\\n\\nA political scientist might seek to assess whether and how there have been shifts over time in those countries pursuing repatriation of cultural patrimony, and those that have been the targets of such inquiries and claims.\\n\\nThose working in law enforcement, diplomacy, intelligence, and national defense and security might reference the index in assessing political risks associated with cultural property cases depending on nation of origin and/or function of the objects in question.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"About \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/about/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"I came to the United States in 1988 after obtaining my B.Tech. degree (Hons.) from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jadavpur.edu/), India in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering.

I worked as a research scientist at the [Institute for Simulation & Training](http://www.ist.ucf.edu/) in Orlando during the years 1988 to 1990, developing the [Distributed Interactive Simulation](http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/) (DIS) project in collaboration with DARPA. My job was to develop simulation models for battle-field networking. DIS has since grown into a [DoD](http://www.defenselink.mil/) standard. This was also when my interests on networking sparked.\\n\\nI joined [Prof. Mostafa Bassiouni\\u2019s](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/%7Ebassi/) network group and started developing algorithms for integrated voice and data networking. I received my M.S. in 1991 and continued towards doctoral study. At a conference in San Diego in 1991, I was introduced to a then new emerging technology called [ATM](http://www.atmforum.com/). I went on to obtain a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/) [of Central Florida](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/) in 1994. In my thesis, I developed congestion control and scheduling techniques for high-speed ATM networks that could provide guarantees to multimedia applications.\\n\\nIn 1994, I was hired by [Georgia State University](http://www.gsu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Information Systems](http://www2.cis.gsu.edu/) department in Atlanta. This was the first time I was in a business school environment. It took a year or so to adjust since everyone around wore suites while I was used to Profs wearing T-shirts and shorts. Anyway I quickly adjusted and began my tenure at GSU. My primary responsibility was to obtain research funding and create a top-notch Telecom program. With the help of some colleagues, I was able to secure a large $1.15 million grant to establish a Center for Digital Commerce. That center is now called [E-Commerce Institute](http://www.eci.gsu.edu/) and has recently successfully launched the GEM (Global E-Commerce MBA) program. In 1996, I also started working at the Broadband Telecommunications Center which was a joint research center between Georgia Tech, GSU and UGA. It was during this time that I worked with Dr. John Limb who later went onto create his startup called Digital Furnace that was later acquired by [Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com/). John ended up to be a wealthy person. Too bad, I did not go. At the BTC, my research on the performance of HFC networks and the economic modeling of access networks received a lot of attention. During this time I was successful in securing [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/) grants for a VBNS extension to GSU and also got involved with the [Internet-2](http://www.internet2.edu/) project. The Telecom program became nationally known and several of my students are working for top networking companies. In 2000, I received tenure and was promoted to Associate Professor.\\n\\nFebruary of 2000 became a turning point in my life. From\\u00a0 being a total academic, I plunged into entrepreneurship and co-founded my own startup [VoiceCore Technologies Inc](http://www.voicecore.com/). The next 18 months were incredible times for me as I wrote business plan, secured seed funding for the company from angel investors and started smooching with venture capitalists (VCs) both in Atlanta and nationwide. We hired developers and soon VoiceCore was of and running deep into product development. We were one of the first companies to develop SIP-based advanced telephony and video-conferencing applications on the net. An end-to-end Quality-of-Service bandwidth broker was also being designed.\\n\\nCurrently I am\\u00a0 fascinated with the Internet and its impact on our daily lives. In the past, my research work has been on ATM scheduling systems, efficient routing protocols, TCP/IP performance over HFC cable networks and all-optical networking. Currently I am exploring fundamental challenges in QOS, Voice over IP, real-time protocols and secured PKI infrastructures. I am particularly concerned with long-term solutions for Internet routing, scalability and end-to-end QOS techniques.\\n\\nDuring the last several years I have been a consultant to top Telecommunications companies like BellSouth.net, Lucent, Cisco, Cabletron Systems, Fore Systems, MediaOne/AT&T, Bank of America\\u00a0 and Hitachi Telecom. I helped design BellSouth Next Generation Data network. I was the local organizing chair for ICNP\\u201997 and ENCOM-98 conference. I served on the program committee for Globecom\\u201999 conference where he was a member in the TPC for Access Networks and Enterprise Services & Applications Symposiums. I was the panel chair on \\u201cVoice over IP\\u201d at the Supercom 2001 June meeting held in Atlanta. I have given over 150 presentations and seminars at various International forums, tutorials and technical talks to industry and academic conferences.\\u00a0I also served as an expert on the Computer Science and Technology Board panel under National Research Council.\\n\\nI\\u00a0 am a member of ACM, IEEE, and IEEE Communications Society. I have published a number of journal and conference papers. I am a member of the SIP working group and IPAC WG within IETF. I am on the program committee for EntNet in IEEE.\\n\\nSince July of 2001, I have moved to [Claremont Graduate University](http://www.cgu.edu/) here in California and embark upon a new academic and entrepreneurial career.

I lived there for six before I also went off to college, but I would go back and visit at Christmas and other school breaks.\\u00a0 My parents eventually returned to the US when I was twenty-three and now live in Michigan.Migrating back to the US for college was a bigger culture shock than I could have ever imagined.\\u00a0 I think I had expected that I would fit right in because I grew up in an American family and had spent the first twelve years of my life in the US, but I almost always felt like a fish out of water.\\u00a0 My teenage experience didn\\u2019t hardly map onto the experiences of my peers at all.\\u00a0 I always stood too close to people. Then, after marrying and spending eleven years in the Midwest doing graduate school (for my husband and also for me) and raising our family, we moved to Saudi Arabia as expats.\\u00a0 We currently live in the Eastern province and have been here just over a year.\\n\\nPeople always say that one of the great things about Mormonism is that \\u201cit\\u2019s the same everywhere,\\u201d but I haven\\u2019t found that to be true at all.\\u00a0 In Mexico, I attended a small English-speaking ward in a Spanish-speaking stake, and it felt like everybody was needed and valued because nobody had family and everybody clung to each other for support.\\u00a0 There wasn\\u2019t much of a test for orthodoxy \\u2014 if you showed up and were willing to help, nobody cared about your political leanings or whether you performed Mormonism in the same way as everybody else.\\u00a0 When I moved back to the US and went to BYU, that was a huge shock for me: my performance of Mormonism really mattered.\\u00a0 How I dressed, spoke, professed my faith, and behaved on Sundays really affected how people viewed me and my position in the social hierarchy.\\u00a0 While I thought it was unique to BYU (and I think it was more intense there), that continued throughout my experience in wards in the US to some degree or another.\\u00a0 We were always welcomed into our new ward whenever we moved, but our social capital varied depending on how much we walked the walk and talked the talk.\\n\\nIn Saudi Arabia, the practice of any religion other than Islam isn\\u2019t allowed, so we aren\\u2019t able to practice our faith in the same way we have in the US or Mexico.\\n\\nWhat I love about Mormonism is the idea of Zion.\\u00a0 I love the idea that we\\u2019re here to be in relationship with one another, to lift each other up and build a world where no poor (spiritually or temporally) live among us.\\u00a0 There is something really beautiful about the idea of knitting our hearts together in love, and that we can all be sealed to each other as an entire human family that is eternal and lasts beyond death.\\u00a0 The thing I value most about living around the world is the opportunity to create so many meaningful relationships, to meet people I would otherwise never meet, and to broaden my knowledge of the human experience.\\u00a0 I feel like I\\u2019m more equipped to build Zion by having experienced so many different cultures and ways of life.\\n\\n![Image 2: Elizabeth in Saudi Arabia](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/01/Elizabeth-in-Saudi-Arabia.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 3: Elizabeth in Oman](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/01/Elizabeth-in-Oman-e1578965977949.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Elizabeth Layton Johnson - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/johnson/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Mia Pennels](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2017/12/Mia_Pennels.jpg)\\n\\nMia Pennels, a dual MBA/MA student in Positive Organizational Psychology and Evaluation, served on the LeAD strategic planning committee and as an assessor and facilitator of the LeAD assessment center.

For our statistical sciences program, students with degrees in statistics or other disciplines will be considered provided they have adequate undergraduate training in mathematics (multivariate calculus, linear algebra), computing (including familiarity with one or more programming languages, e.g., R, MATLAB, Python) and upper-division probability and statistics (equivalent to math 151/152 at the Claremont Colleges). For our program in computational and applied math, students with undergraduate degrees in engineering, the sciences, economics, etc. will also be considered, provided that they have completed multivariate/vector calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical methods (including programming languages, such as MATLAB) as part of their undergraduate studies.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nGRE scores are required for PhD applicants and are optional for Master\\u2019s applicants.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn the PhD program, the students are allowed to transfer up to 24 semester units of relevant coursework from another graduate program. At the master\\u2019s level, CGU allows the transfer of up to six semester units for its 36-unit programs (the IMS master\\u2019s programs are 32 units; thus typically up to four units can be transferred).\\n\\n##### Program\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe Institute of Mathematical Sciences has five core faculty members. The total number of math faculty in all seven Claremont Colleges is approximately 60, many of whom teach courses that are open to graduate students and are willing to advise doctoral student research.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe master\\u2019s programs are based on 32 units (eight courses) of graduate coursework. The PhD programs require 72 units of coursework, passing of a\\u00a0qualifying exam, completing the research tools requirements, and successful oral presentations of the thesis proposal and the thesis defense.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWe offer specialization in various areas of pure math, in computational and applied math, in statistical sciences, in financial engineering, in industrial and engineering applied math, and in computational sciences.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYes.

His father, a factory engineer, died when he was a teenager, and his mother, despite never having had the opportunity to gain literacy or education, was a great support to him as her pursued his studies. He entered the field of education, ultimately getting a master\\u2019s degree in the subject. He became a teacher and principal and is now retired. He is married with three daughters who are active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\n\\nSurukat joined the church in 1995, attracted to the business-like time keeping of the meetings. In time he gained conviction about the truthfulness of the Church and eventually served as branch president and bishop, where he had opportunities to develop spiritual as well as temporal leadership skills. He believes that God preserved his life after he was shot multiple times by an armed robber so that he could live to serve God.\\n\\nMormonism has not always been an easy path in Nigeria, he recounts. Many there believe the Church is a cult. Within the congregation, there are also challenges, particularly surrounding the financial needs of the members. Often there are not enough funds to assist all those who ask for it. But he finds particular sustenance in taking the sacrament, which he has not missed in ten years.\\n\\nUltimately, he sees the Church as promoting a unifying message that all are brothers and sisters and children of God. As an educator, he believes that Latter-day Saint schools might be a way for the Church to spread further in Nigeria.\\n\\n![Image 2: Surakat and his wife in front of a church building](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/4-Oyebanji-with-wife.jpg)\\n\\nSurakat and his wife in front of a church building\\n\\n![Image 3: Surakat with a fellow church member](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/3-Oyebanji-with-member.jpg)\\n\\nSurakat with a fellow church member\\n\\n![Image 4: Oyebanji](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/1-Oyebanji-redone.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 5: Surakat in the 1980s](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/2-Oyebanji-in80s.jpg)\\n\\nSurakat in the 1980s\\n\\n![Image 6: Surakat in the 1990s](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/5-Oyebanji-in-40s.jpg)\\n\\nSurakat in the 1990s\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Surakat Oyebanji - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/oyebanji/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**We invite you to join us for an on-campus tour!

There are two options you can use to make this gift to us:\\n\\n**Payable on death (POD).\\\\*** By placing a POD designation on your bank account or certificate of deposit, you can name one or more persons or charities as the beneficiary of all funds once you, the account owner, pass away. The beneficiary you name has no rights to the funds until after your lifetime. Until that time, you remain in control and are free to use the money in the bank account, to change the beneficiary or to close the account.\\n\\nBy setting up your bank account or certificate of deposit in this way, the estate planning and administration process is simplified. The executor or administrator of your estate will not have to take any action to ensure that your account transfers to whomever you designated. Simply ask your bank representative about the one or two easy steps you need to take in order to place a POD designation on your bank account or certificate of deposit.\\n\\n**Transfer on death (TOD).\\\\*** By placing a TOD designation on your brokerage or investment account, that account will be paid over to one or more persons or charities after your lifetime. It is not necessary for the TOD designation to transfer all of the account solely to charity\\u2014you can designate a certain percentage of the account. Like a POD account, with a TOD account the beneficiary you name has no rights to the funds until after your lifetime. Until that time, you are free to use the money in the brokerage account, to change the beneficiary or to close the account.\\n\\nA TOD designation also simplifies the estate planning and administration process. The executor or administrator of your estate will not have to take any action to ensure that your securities transfer to whomever you designated. To set up the TOD endorsement, simply contact your investment advisor and provide instructions regarding the change.\\n\\n\\\\*State laws govern payable on death accounts and transfer on death accounts.

Hernandez**\\n\\nJerry Voorhis was many things: a progressive congressman, a wealthy philanthropist and a founder of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.\\n\\nFor Ben O'Brien, Voorhis\\u2014who received CGU's first master's degree in education in 1928\\u2014and the Voorhis School For Boys were powerful influences. As a student at the school Voorhis founded, Ben said he learned the meaning of success, the importance of learning a trade and the power of charity.\\n\\n\\\"Jerry was a gifted, brilliant teacher,\\\" Ben says during an interview for a Cal Poly Pomona oral history project. \\\"I said many times, and it's largely true, that what I learned in the ninth grade at the Voorhis School let me coast through Pomona College, let me coast through law school at Georgetown and stayed with me the rest of my life.\\\"\\n\\nBecause of the strength of his beloved teacher's ties to CGU, Ben began supporting CGU in 1995. Working with the Voorhis alumni association, Ben's generosity helped establish a fellowship as well as fund memorial plaques for three benches located in a courtyard at Harper Hall. The fellowship and courtyard are named for Voorhis, while the plaques are dedicated to Ben's brothers.\\n\\nBen passed away in November 2014. His three brothers also attended the Voorhis School.\\n\\nThe four O'Brien brothers grew up poor in La Verne, California. Their father had abandoned them, and their mother worked in an orange packinghouse to make ends meet. Seeking a better life for her sons, Ben's mother enrolled the boys at the Voorhis School.\\n\\nVoorhis and his father founded the school in 1928 in San Dimas, California, to provide impoverished boys with an education, vocational training and employment.\\n\\nBen learned how to operate a linotype machine and grow peas. He played football and basketball. During chapel services, he says he recalls Voorhis preaching about how \\\"being successful means helping other people and doing good for other people.\\\"\\n\\nVoorhis served five terms as a democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, provided Cal Poly Pomona with its first campus, and dedicated himself to religious, social, and educational causes after he retired.\\n\\nVoorhis' philanthropy\\u2014his family money funded the school\\u2014made an impression on Ben, even at an early age.\\n\\n\\\"We knew that all of the money that took care of us, Jerry could have had,\\\" Ben says. \\\"He could have had yachts, he could have had girlfriends by the dozen, he could have been whooping it up all over the world. We knew that.\\\"\\n\\nBen and his brothers later left the school, which closed in 1939, to seek their fortunes. According to Krystle DiPaolo, Ben's niece, Ben became a lawyer and federal judge, his brother, Earl, became a law enforcement officer in the Bay Area, and his brother, Walter, became a career Army officer.\\n\\nDiPaolo echoed her uncle's sentiments; Voorhis and his school were pivotal to Ben's success.\\n\\n\\\"Basically, he did so well because of Jerry,\\\" she says. \\\"\\\\[The O'Brien brothers\\\\] wouldn't have had that, but for Jerry Voorhis. The four brothers, four families\\u2014it changed all of their lives.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2: Lara Kolinchak](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/student-lara-kolinchak.jpg)\\n\\nLara Kolinchak\\n\\nThe H.

So far 15 students have received the fellowship, including Lara Kolinchak, a history student in the school of arts and humanities' Ph.D. program.\\n\\nLara described receiving the fellowship as an amazing honor.\\n\\n\\\"This fellowship encourages me to be dedicated to my studies and to acknowledge the help as I strive to complete my efforts with distinction,\\\" Lara says. \\\"Additionally, this fellowship motivates me to strive for excellence in life and educational pursuits.

I was instructed to never open an umbrella once inside of someone\\u2019s home as it was thought to bring \\u201cduppies\\u201d (unwelcomed ghosts) and why children should never chew chewing gum as it was thought that the gum would wrap around your \\u201cnavel string\\u201d (bellybutton) and \\u201chang yuh\\u201d (choke) from the inside.\\n\\nI believed these legends. In my young brain, the adults were never wrong. It meant that I would often run home before the streetlights came on with fear that I met some unwelcomed guest or worse yet, ran into the Heart Man who would only signal doom and gloom in my life.\\n\\nI consider myself one of the fortunate girls who spent more time outdoors than glued to television sets. I hung out with the neighborhood boys all summer where we would climb all the trees and would relieve our neighbors of the yummy plums, ackees or whatever fruit we could eat that day. I fell out of those trees, scraped knees and learned how to fight in that tiny coastal neighborhood.\\n\\nLooking back now, I recognized that those early childhood years taught me so much about being a strong individual. As the lone girl among a group of boys, I learned early on that I had a responsibility to believe that I had power and brought value to my friends\\u2019 group. As wonderful as this sentiment is, I recognize that it sometimes doesn\\u2019t transfer when it comes to my spiritual life.\\n\\nI am still a relatively new convert. In December, I celebrated my fourth year as a member. In this time, I\\u2019ve become really familiar with Mormon Guilt. I know some of you who are active members are probably somewhere ready with reeds ready to yell at me for using the \\u201cM\\u201d word yet I\\u2019ve realized that Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Guilt just doesn\\u2019t have the same catchy ring to it.\\n\\nIn my relatively short time as a member, I\\u2019ve always wondered if there was a switch that magically turned on when it came to Mormon Guilt. Before joining the church, I was never the person who needed validation where it came to my understanding of being a good person. Yet, as I watched myself going through the motions during the height of COVID, I recognized that although I had attempted to nip the part of me which overcompensated in the bud, that COVID brought all of those over-compulsive behaviors back.\\n\\nBefore spiritually combusting a few months ago, I never understood spiritual exhaustion and wondered why people complained suddenly and left the church. In my eyes, I was the good, model example of a young woman who aspired to do all she could to live the gospel. Each time I caught myself slipping, I would add a greater load upon myself.\\n\\n![Image 2: Ramona Morris](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/04/Ramona-Morris.jpeg)  \\nTo be seen as an example, I believed that needed to spread myself wafer thin so that others could see my efforts. I attended two Institute classes (and still do).I would attend church like my life depended upon it even on the weeks where I was too sick to stand without assistance. I believed that saying \\u201cno\\u201d meant unworthiness and showed a lack of faith and trust in my Heavenly Father who would give me the energy to do everything I put my mind to.\\n\\nA few months in, after attending my friend\\u2019s sacrament meeting in India via Zoom, I cracked. That morning, sitting alone in my room at two in the morning, I realised that I had finally bitten off more than I could chew. After months of floundering and trying to keep my head above water, I had finally hit rock bottom.\\n\\nEven now, I have never felt that weight so heavily. I cracked, breaking completely down the middle. I could almost hear the devil on my shoulder saying \\u201cdah fuh lick yuh\\u201d (serves you right/ that\\u2019s what you get). I felt more exhausted than ever, and my anxiety spiraled out of control. I soon realized that I had to take a step back.\\n\\nCultivating a healthy relationship spiritually was much more important than \\u201ckeeping up wid the Joneses\\u201d (trying to be in competition with others). I dialed back and found unique ways to do spiritual things.\\n\\nMonths later, when I caught COVID-19 myself, I recognized the importance of strong simplicity as it relates to living in accordance with God\\u2019s will. Sure, serving him with all our might means that we may have to stretch ourselves, but it doesn\\u2019t mean that in our efforts, we should break under the pressure which stems from cultural norms we experience as members of the church.\\n\\nIf we fall into the trap of competition, contention and comparison, we need to recognize that this has nothing to do with being a good Latter Day Saint. The most important lesson learned is that \\u201cOvercompensation is not of the Spirit\\u201d. It comes from our own innate need to be seen, recognized and validated.\\n\\nAnd maybe \\u2026 we need not to let church culture determine who we become as human beings.\\n\\n\\\\* Ramona is from the small Caribbean island of Barbados.

This is a collection about what it\\u2019s like to be in the Restoration tradition during the pandemic, and I have been a member of two Restoration churches. I grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then converted to Community of Christ in my mid-twenties. Some parts of this experience have been healing while other parts have been difficult. I was once curious enough about this type of faith swapping that I asked people who have converted either way the question: how ask being a member of two Restoration churches been a blessing in your life? How people answered that question told me a lot about themselves. No answer was the same. Both churches have been in my life during the pandemic, so I\\u2019m also going to try to answer that question myself as I explain my experience.\\n\\nWhere was I when the COVID-19 pandemic began? College! I had the (oh so unlucky) experience of being an undergraduate senior when the pandemic first hit the United States. Canceled events. No in-person classes. Closed library. Remote campus job. Learning Zoom. Churches closed. Church on Zoom or Facebook. Restaurants takeout only. Wear masks inside. Once I was done in the semester, I decided that I didn\\u2019t want to make any big decisions, so I moved back in with my parents. At first, I thought I could wait it out.\\n\\nWhat has your church life been like during the pandemic? This has probably been the most \\u201cpassive\\u201d time I\\u2019ve had with church activity in my life. My university city Community of Christ congregation started using Zoom for their worship services as soon as the pandemic closed congregations. There were also a variety of other Community of Christ groups having online services as well as activities like Reunion. In October 2020, Community of Christ leadership approved doing the different sacraments over the internet, and I\\u2019ve witnessed a lot of online communion services and even one confirmation where no one was in the same room. I also did church with my parents when the LDS Church was having home church (description next). Back at home my Latter-day Saint dad was enthusiastic about keeping church going when \\u201chome church\\u201d was announced. He scheduled our small family living room Sunday service exactly like a ward sacrament meeting: three hymns (opening, sacrament, closing), opening and closing prayer, the sacrament, and a talk by one of us on a subject. We played the music off YouTube and sang with our personal hymn books. My dad already owned white plastic sacrament tray, and he\\u2019d prepare and bless the sacrament on his walker while sitting in his lounge chair. In retrospect, I could have let reservations go and just participated more with my family. Sometimes I complained to my dad that our family service went on unnecessarily long or I didn\\u2019t want to do the work of opening myself up and giving my opinions during discussion. My dad was always happy when I participated.\\n\\nWhat have been your most meaningful church experiences during the pandemic? My father passed away in May 2021. It was a lot for my mom, older sister, and I. My dad had medical problems including PTSD for several decades, but he had a fall in a parking lot a year before the pandemic which led to his health declining more. My parents have been living in the same area for over twenty years, and the ward I grew up in was on top of helping us. The bishop and another ward friend met us at the hospital when we got the news. Another ward member helped my mom break down what she needed to do next and was there was a resource. Several women from Relief Society helped clean and organize our crowded home before out-of-town family came in. There was food after the funeral service. People I grew up with reached out to us with cards and flowers and messages.\\n\\n![Image 2: funeral flowers](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/09/R_1fa9alE92Yp499T_funeral-flowers-scaled.jpg)  \\nMy Community of Christ experience has been more long distance. I\\u2019ve made friends in the church that live in different states, and I have been able to sometimes watch them give sermons or other ministry because of all the online outreach from different churches. I have spent more time reaching out to people which led to me making a friend.\\n\\nHow has your faith changed during the pandemic? I have come to two realizations. One is that I seriously needed some identity and faith grounding. Not necessarily the pandemic made me realize this but being able to stay at home for a year made it obvious. I had taken in these new ideas about faith, and I had all these new experiences at college and with Community of Christ that helped me grow personally over the past several years. That\\u2019s caused my sense of self in flux a lot, and I\\u2019ve realized that I need to get a clearer picture of myself to move forward. Second, I needed to build the kind of faith that is able react to crisis. People have always helped me while I was in crisis, but it\\u2019s been scary to me to think I could support people in their crisis when it delt with their spiritual needs. That\\u2019s one thing that the world is going to need from me right now: help in crisis.\\n\\nWhat does it mean to be in the Restoration tradition during COVID-19? I almost think this is a better research question to ask a couple years down the road because we\\u2019re all still trying to figure that out. All churches have structures, and it\\u2019s becoming more obvious which of our structures are strong and which have their weak points. In my experience, some people are pushing their structures for help while other people are thinking more about a personal response and taking it upon themselves to act outside those structures. We need to both give what we have and look for more because we need help from every direction. It\\u2019s been painful to me to watch weaker church structures strain more where there was already strain. I think it\\u2019s going to be my challenge in life to get through feelings of powerlessness and to figure out what change I can make in the world.\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nShare\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Pandemic Faith: My Churches, My Faith, My Hope - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/pandemic-faith/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: This Global Latter-day Life](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2022/09/TGLDL-logo-with-dialogue-podcast-symbol-150x150.jpg)\\n\\nThis Global Latter-day Life\\n\\nNaomi: Single in Botswana\\n\\n![Image 2: Loading](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/assets/css/images/player/images/icon-loader.svg)\\n\\n00:00 /\\n\\n30:24\\n\\nRSS Feed\\n\\nThis episode explores the oral life history of Naomi, a convert from Botswana, who navigates the challenges of Latter-day Saint single life in a context where societal norms and parental expectations sometimes conflict with church chastity standards.

Just me? Surprisingly enough, homeschooling my children in German and cancelling everything in the near future, outside of staying home, was not in my dream plans.\\n\\nInstead of my normal routine, we now spend our mornings doing math homework while listening to the Lego Movie 2 soundtrack, neither of which I really enjoy. Lately the song \\u2018Everything\\u2019s Not Awesome\\u2019 has really spoken to me, maybe because I\\u2019ve listened to it 657 times, maybe because it\\u2019s clearly designed to get stuck inside your head.\\n\\nI really thought I would be good at this. I\\u2019m great in a crisis and I\\u2019ve always excelled under stress. Living overseas for the past nine years has forced me to be adaptive and flexible. I have made three international moves pregnant, had children in two different countries, and studied and worked while raising my children.\\n\\nI watched the press conference from the Swiss government with my family. When it was announced that schools were closing for three weeks, my fluent children were cheering and jumping up and down long before I fully comprehended the announcement. After recovering some dignity, I went into a planning panic. I spent hours researching home school schedules, planning our routines and compiling job charts complete with life skills to be learned and options for child directed projects. I printed out a \\u2018couch to 5k\\u2019 training plan, made my own an age-based English literature program, bought a Lego robot, and announced that all screen time would be in German or French. I was prepared to be great at this.\\n\\nBut I wasn\\u2019t.\\n\\nWithin a week I felt like the lyrics of the song, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the point? There\\u2019s no hope. Awesomeness was a pipe dream\\u201d. But mostly I\\u2019ve just identified with Batman, \\u201cI just wanna eat carbs, pass the ice cream\\u201d.\\n\\nSure, on paper I may have performed well. But early into week two I felt like I was sinking into quicksand while juggling shards of glass.\\n\\n![Image 1: two people at lake](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/03/R_3kprEAkZK3eTD1h_oOTW8Cn3RGkLwy34MhArg.jpg)\\n\\nLast week my husband walked into the kitchen during a homeschool session and took some pictures to document this abnormal time. When I saw the pictures later it was enlightening in a very horrible way. In every picture I was grimacing and angry, most likely trying to discern which work sheet was the Verbenheft and which was the Verbarbeitsblatt. I wondered if this clenched teeth determination to excel would be how my children would remember this time, me barking orders and demanding they do extra math to compensate for not completing their Deutch work correctly\\u2026.\\n\\nWe will probably not finish all our worksheets or send in the requested videos to music teachers. I may not receive an outstanding mark on my dissertation. That is okay. It is not essential that we keep our home clean or make robots instead of watching old episodes of Duck Tales. It is not essential that we hold a two-hour home church service. It is not essential that we are always happy or productive.\\n\\nWhat is important is that we find ways to be okay.

The first personal computers were typically sold as do-it-yourself kits like the Altair 8800 (pictured below), and were more often appealing to electronics enthusiasts than to everyday people. However, innovators committed to making computers accessible created increasingly efficient and intuitive technology. Simultaneously, computers became less expensive to mass-produce which encouraged technology companies to focus on the mass marketability of personal computers. The introduction of easy-to-use, affordable personal computers ensured the commercial success of these machines.\\n\\n![Image 2: a computer is sitting on a table](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh1L3knbl9q_MHng-LL54elJd5Hh5cZ_Nv9d7oJFFUavoQOD1sOHfBsTRBrmNxM_nlWXmdZUUBCAd3iV6VfjaBOrYIZrQyzAG10m-IEErvpGofWHKEIJ7BxsaCXjEuxm1yRR3fyKoYCQ2dbUKkjWh8ROgqSWtCqpQaSNowQgt8NrScLm5blYlllPLCS=s1495)\\n\\nAs more people bought personal computers, more technology companies built machines that could perform a variety of tasks. Increasing flexibility and customizability was important in showing the ways in which computers could change people\\u2019s lives. In 1977, Apple released the Apple II\\u2014the first computer with color graphics\\u2014and transformed people\\u2019s perception of the possibilities for computers. Users of personal computers liked color displays and high-quality sound because these features allowed them to tailor the computer to their needs. Teachers in the late 1970s, like MOTAL\\u2019s own Greta Nagel, were thrilled to have access to these remarkably learner-friendly machines in their classroom. Greta recalls:\\n\\n_\\u201cI ran a reading lab as a specialist in a Title I school when the Apple II came out, and we had four computers to use as a learning center. The computer was friendly and forgiving. It was patient and gave immediate feedback. If the student got something wrong, there was an instant opportunity to try again and get it right.\\u201d_\\n\\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature of the Apple II was that it was the first personal computer with color graphics, which the company advertised with a redesigned color logo (pictured below). This computer was also notable because it was easily customizable depending on the user\\u2019s needs. In particular, the software that came with the computer made it useful for business people, reaffirming the potential that personal computers had for transforming the workplace. Color graphics also cemented Apple\\u2019s reputation as the preferred computer for graphic artists.\\n\\n![Image 3: the apple ii logo on a black background](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhK6hKt1X4awlE9L3XwxYHimSvtmMB75EcQCFJRR8UpD2evDwHEt7B2ts32qDoucaAcGuigWW-bftfn4g3iZ7eBXFhLF7d2f-uXZFT_amfZkp4WtTBQW596OndAqXOBt2sh-uhJ8OhH4x08-2pw8ULovZ_-xAVrONVtxiGSg3aZBzEdCltepi6ktSCy=s400)\\n\\nIn 1979 Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston introduced VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet, for the Apple II. The application was hugely popular and exponentially increased sales of the Apple II. The VisiCalc was a true game-changer in the industry and paved the way for today\\u2019s electronic spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel.\\n\\nLast year, the Paul Gray Personal Computing Museum hosted the inventor of VisiCalc, Dan Bricklin, as part of our speaker series [Decoding the Past: Conversations with PC Innovators](https://research.cgu.edu/paul-gray-pc-museum/events/).\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nShare\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Artifact of the Month with MOTAL: Part 2 \\u2014 Paul Gray PC Museum\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/paul-gray-pc-museum/2021/11/02/artifact-of-the-month-with-motal-part-2/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"* * *\\n\\nThe Career and Professional Development office at Claremont Graduate University is a forward-facing full-service office dedicated to guide and support students and alumni as they navigate their career journey.

For example, PepsiCo credited the creation of guacamole-favored chips \\u2013 one of their most popular items \\u2013 to their diverse management team. Guacamole-flavored chips is a novel idea that was able to tap into the $13 trillion minority market.\\u00a0 The old notion that diversity is only needed because it\\u2019s moral and legal has expired. We now see diversity in the workplace as a competitive edge, an increase in profit, and most importantly a path to innovation (Robinson & Dechant, 1997). However, organizations must actively develop minority leaders if they hope to tap into that innovation. Managing and developing minority leaders continues to be a challenge (Ensher & Murphy, 1997). Here are some ways to make minority mentorships successful.\\n\\n**Have an Honest and Open Conversation**  \\nWhen mentor and mentee are meeting for the first time, acknowledge differences to create a sense of openness and a pathway toward trust. Simply state, \\u201cEven though we have a different gender/race/age/etc., I will still work to support you in the formal matters of work, and I am here for you regarding the informal matters of work.\\u201d This step will allow both parties to feel comfortable to move on to a deeper relationship and is essential for minority mentorships (Ensher & Murphy, 1997). Once there is an open discussion on the surface differences, the duo can have a quality mentorship that moves toward a more in-depth interaction.\\n\\n**Create Collaborative Goals**  \\nInstead of saying what _you_ are going to do or what _I_ am going to do, change the dialogue to what _we_ are going to do. Framing goals as shared goals highlights collaboration and helps the mentee and mentor trust each other (Wasburn, 2007). After the goal is complete, the duo will feel positive emotions towards each other as they see the positive results of their relationship.\\n\\n**Focus on Leadership Development**  \\nHelp your mentee prepare for a future role as a mentor. When the mentee becomes a mentor, they will be able to see how much they have grown. As a result of appreciating the process, the mentee will continue to grow and mature long after the initial mentorship relationship (Dunham-Taylor et al., 2008).\\n\\nEffective minority mentorship does not greatly differ from other mentorships if individual differences are addressed up front; the first step, therefore, is the most important. However, when minority mentorships are effective, it can lead to greater innovation. Taking the time to do minority mentorship right will lead to greater chances of success.\\n\\n### About the Author\\n\\nAmber Kea-Edwards is a research associate at LeAD Labs and a Ph.D. Candidate in Positive Organizational Psychology at Claremont Graduate University.

She has an established reputation in the Los Angeles arts community.\\n\\n\\u201cLaura is a great pick to lead CBMArts,\\u201d Neil said about Zucker\\u2019s appointment. \\u201cShe directed our arts management program for seven years and knows all the players at CGU. And as the Arts Commission\\u2019s executive director, she knows all the players in L.A.\\u2019s arts sector, too. She\\u2019s an exceptional educator and will serve CBMArts students, faculty, and alumni very well.\\u201d\\n\\nCGU\\u2019s arts business and management program was still in its infancy when Zucker first agreed in 2008 to direct\\u2014and teach in\\u2014the program while serving as the L.A. County Arts Commission executive director.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve always believed in this program,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand I\\u2019ve been invested in it from the beginning. It\\u2019s really an honor now to come back and lead it.\\u201d\\n\\nLeading in the Creative Capital of the World\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nLos Angeles is one of just three U.S. cities (the others are New York City and San Francisco) that are considered \\u201carts super cities,\\u201d with very high concentrations of artists relative to the rest of the population. Artists and art organizations, Zucker says, are an integral part of L.A.\\u2019s economic engine, and that is why \\u201carts education is so critically needed now.\\u201d\\n\\nFor her, CBMArts is ideally positioned both geographically and in its academic programming to respond to that need.\\n\\n\\u201cA significant motivation for many of the students who choose CGU\\u2019s arts management programs is the fact that we are located in the creative capital of the world,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cWhat they find here are opportunities to concretely innovate in the field and have a significant impact on cultural life, not only in our region but across the world.\\u201d\\n\\nThat word \\u201cimpact\\u201d also aptly describes Zucker\\u2019s career in the creative industries, including her 25-year tenure with the L.A. County Arts Commission, during which she created and oversaw the civic art policy for the county and directed the funding for more than 400 arts organizations.\\n\\nAs busy as she was in that county role, Zucker says she always sought to maintain ties with CGU and stay involved as an educator in its arts management programs. As is true of many CBMArts\\u2019 faculty members, that connection has enabled her to bring academic theory together with her real-world experiences.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat I\\u2019ve loved about being involved with CGU\\u2019s programs is that it\\u2019s always helped me balance practice with theory,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBeing involved with CBMArts has provided a space for me and our other faculty members to think deeply about issues we\\u2019re facing in the field. That, in turn, gives our students a clearer understanding of the kinds of issues they might confront one day in their own careers\\u2014or already are.\\u201d\\n\\nRestoring and Integrating the Arts\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring her tenure with the county, Zucker says she discovered her \\u201cinner policy wonk\\u201d and experienced a deep excitement in having the ability to produce changes on the macro level.\\n\\n\\u201cHaving an ability to affect a huge arts ecology like Los Angeles through legislative initiatives and programs that lift all of the boats was both challenging and exhilarating for me,\\u201d she explains.\\n\\nZucker\\u2019s county work included implementing a regional initiative to restore arts education to all 81 of the county\\u2019s public-school districts (though Zucker says that restoration is just the tip of the iceberg, and more work remains.) She also led the effort to create a strategic plan for Cultural Equity and Inclusion that produced 13 actionable recommendations (with the County Board of Supervisors adopting seven of these so far). She also directed an $80-million revitalization of the Ford Theatre. She created the largest paid internship program in the arts in the country for undergraduates through a public-private partnership with the Getty Trust.\\n\\nZucker is especially proud of the arts internship program, which today employs more than 275 graduates every summer for ten weeks in good-paying positions with nonprofit organizations that enable them to build networks and pursue careers in arts management.\\n\\n\\u201cI have always called paid internships the secret sauce of the arts engine in L.A.,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThere was no place for the undergraduate students in the arts internship program to go on to graduate work before the program with CGU started, and we were losing them to other parts of the country. Today, CBMArts has become an important pipeline for these undergraduates to pursue mission-driven careers.\\u201d\\n\\nZucker also notes the commission\\u2019s work under her leadership on creating a civic arts program for Los Angeles that integrates art into all county capital projects and has been a way, she says, of \\u201cdemocratizing arts and culture in the county.\\u201d This program utilizes one percent of the cost of public construction projects\\u2014ranging from $10,000 to $1 million\\u2014and uses it to include works of art in all disciplines in these projects.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a way to transform how the county thinks about its public spaces,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t just want art locked up in buildings where some people won\\u2019t have access to it. This effort was made to integrate art through all public spaces, whether a renovated park or a new library or an animal control center or a hospital and has made art what I believe it should be, like breathing\\u2014something that is always there, around us.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom Actor to Advocate\\n----------------------\\n\\nScratch the surface of any arts administrator, Zucker says, and you\\u2019ll find an artist. It was true for her. In the early 1970s, Zucker felt an inner calling to be an actor and attended the Yale School of Drama.\\n\\nBut what changed her career trajectory were two words: Meryl Streep.\\n\\nStreep was one of Zucker\\u2019s classmates at Yale, and \\u201cit was clear to me,\\u201d she says, \\u201cthat she was wildly more talented than I was and was being cast in all the plum roles I wanted. That\\u2019s what got me thinking that I should be directing instead\\u201d\\u2014until the department\\u2019s head told her women couldn\\u2019t be directors.\\n\\nFrustrated, Zucker left Yale to pursue a directing career, which in turn led her to producing and managing a theater. Her experiences gave her an epiphany about the many opportunities open to artists in the creative industries.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s only after working as an artist that you begin to realize there are myriad other interesting career options,\\u201d she says. \\u201cMany artists discover that it can be just as creative to serve in a leadership role and enable other artists to do what they do. I realized it\\u2019s all a matter of scale, whether I was running a theater and helping produce artists\\u2019 works, or working for Los Angeles County, where the scale increased in ways I never could have imagined. It\\u2019s all been enormously gratifying.\\u201d\\n\\nThe disappointment she experienced at Yale over pursuing a directing career has given Zucker a sympathy and sensitivity to the discrimination that can take place in the arts industry. One of the last large initiatives she led with the commission was the Cultural Equity and Inclusion Initiative mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\\u201cAlthough I don\\u2019t have the lived experience many have had in not having access to opportunities in arts and culture, as a young woman, I experienced gender disparity directly,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI think that\\u2019s one of the most important things our program at CBMArts addresses. We have an incredibly diverse student body and faculty, and the future of arts and culture in our country and the world is going to be about the acceptance and cross-fertilization and valuing of all cultural traditions.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Power of CBMArts Alumni\\n---------------------------\\n\\nOne of the new efforts now underway to increase the visibility of CBMArts and highlight its value proposition is a special series of alumni panels. For Zucker, these panel events will highlight the program\\u2019s many outstanding graduates\\u2014there are some 320 members in the CBMArts alumni community\\u2014many of whom have moved into substantial roles in their professions.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I started with the program, it was nascent, and we had no alumni to speak of,\\u201d she says, \\u201cbut now one of the joys I have is seeing all the amazing places our alumni are working.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople don\\u2019t really realize all the possible career paths, so I think these panels over the course of the year will help everyone see the possibilities of what can be done with this degree,\\u201d Zucker says.\\n\\nReflecting on her long association with arts management at CGU, Zucker says she takes deep personal satisfaction in these alumni events and in listening to the achievements of the program\\u2019s graduates.\\n\\n\\u201cNo matter how my role changed, almost everybody has been my student. I\\u2019ve taught there almost every year since the program\\u2019s inception. It\\u2019s so fantastic to be part of something long enough to see the students blossom in their careers.\\u201d\\n\\n*   **Learn more about the** [**Center for Business & Management of the Arts**](https://www.cgu.edu/center/center-for-business-management-of-the-arts/)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Does Laura Zucker Owe Meryl Streep a Thank You?

It focuses on the nations\\u2019 culturally diverse youth as it examines neurocognitive, genetic, environmental, social, and cultural factors influencing tobacco and alcohol use behavior in order to develop more effective prevention programs.\\n\\nA collaborative effort, the center joins the newly formed School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University with research partners at the [University of Southern California](http://mph.usc.edu/), [SRI International](http://www.sri.com/), and the municipal Centers for Disease Control in three of China\\u2019s largest cities: Chengdu, Qingdao, and Wuhan.\\n\\nThe center\\u2019s specific aims are to investigate the efficacy of tobacco and alcohol use prevention programs (1) across cultures, (2) within specific cultural and environmental contexts, and (3) among individuals, explicitly examining the role of neurocognitive attributes and genetics across these three areas.\\n\\nNeurocognitive and genetic studies that fail to properly account for the environmental, social, and cultural contexts in which tobacco and alcohol use behaviors occur will likely be unsuccessful in identifying and characterizing key traits. Likewise, studies that focus solely on such factors as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and social norms may reach incorrect conclusions if they do not consider individual differences such.\\n\\nInsight into malleable environmental, social, and cultural risk factors provides strong targets for public health intervention at the population level. Understanding the neurocognitive and genetic contribution to these factors, however, is imperative in uncovering the underlying etiology at the individual level.\\n\\nIn addition, a population-level public health intervention that appears to have weak effects overall might indeed have strong effects among a subgroup of the population. It is important, therefore, to investigate individual differences in responsiveness to prevention programs.\\n\\nIn pursuing this research, the center fosters the integration of theories and methods from various disciplines, thereby bridging their unique perspectives to create innovative ways of tackling complex research questions.\\n\\nAmong the disciplines represented by our researchers are social, experimental, clinical, and health psychology; genetic and molecular epidemiology; neuroscience and neurogenetics; quantitative genetics; psychometrics; education; communication; health behavior; statistics; nutritional epidemiology; public health; medicine; sociology; and health policy.\\n\\nOther Research Centers\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe Pacific Rim Transdisciplinary Tobacco & Alcohol Use Research Center is one of several research centers pursuing research around the country.

Uniquely and intentionally situated at the intersection of K-12 schools and higher education, her experiences have accrued into informed and nuanced views of the challenges and especially the opportunities in K-16 education. Whether teaching, researching, or supporting teachers in the field, Hatkoff remains invested in facilitating humanizing, supportive, and generative relationships between students, households, schools, and communities. As a Los Angeles native, Hatkoff prioritized developing a nuanced view of the local educational landscape; to that end, she has studied, observed, and learned from teachers and students in more than 100 classrooms across more than 80 K-12 schools in the greater Los Angeles area. Her research interests include culturally responsive K-16+ practices and policies, critical social justice teaching competencies, classroom and school ecology, effective and mutually empowering pedagogy, and strength-based views of schools, teachers, students, households, and communities.\\n\\nHatkoff was instrumental in designing and securing a $3.3 million Teacher Quality Partnership grant from the U.S. Department of Education, which supported a high-quality residency pathway to teaching for candidates committed to supporting students and households in the greater Los Angeles area.\\n\\nPreviously, Hatkoff served as the program associate for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded Digital Fellows Program, run by the Association of Chief Academic Officers. In that position, Hatkoff provided provosts and chief academic officers with critical information, resources, and support to help their faculty understand and adopt high quality digital courseware to enhance undergraduate experiences, persistence, and success.

Our 300 students span multiple program areas ranging from arts management to financial engineering. We rank in the top ten business schools in the nation for percentage of women students and are proud to have 27 countries represented in our classes. Despite this immense diversity, our students are united in their passion for creative leadership and their commitment to Peter Drucker\\u2019s people-oriented management philosophy.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOur faculty members publish in peer-reviewed journals and most work as consultants\\u2014 which means they work on the cutting edge of the current business world. They are also widely recognized for their scholarly acumen and contributions to business theory. For example, Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen earned the International Leadership Association\\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award and Professor Bernie Jaworski was awarded the Mahajan Award from the American Marketing Association. Unlike bigger schools, the Drucker-Ito School provides numerous opportunities for our students to interact with our stellar faculty; indeed, we have a low student to faculty ratio of 10 to 1.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOne of Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s premiere programs, dual degrees offer students the opportunity to earn a second degree in only one to two additional semesters. The MBA is the most popular pairing for the dual degree as it provides the broad management training of the MBA with a thorough specialization in an academic or professional field.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nGraduate school is a significant investment of resources that promises to reward you with significant returns over your lifetime. In recognition of this fact, we recently raised funds to expand our fellowship program and now disperse $500,000 annually to reduce the tuition cost of our students. Indeed, 60 percent of our students receive some level of fellowship (in addition to federal student loan programs available to nearly 100 percent of domestic students).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe\\u00a0experienced staff of the [Drucker Office of Career Strategy](https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/careers/) start working with you before you even come to campus by advising you on your resume and assisting you with your internship search. When you get to campus and go through orientation, we help you complete a Career Map and Action Plan to help you make the most of your education. We are committed to providing you with world-class support and guidance in achieving your career goals.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWe take pride in our notable alumni as well as those who work every day as leaders within major companies such as Disney, ESRI, Mizuho, and Toyota. Our students develop immediately applicable skills that lead not only to career opportunities, but also salary increases. Our alumni in California on average see their incomes increase approximately $40,000 between the first year after graduation and the fifth.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWith its decades-long history of producing leaders, the Drucker School has a strong alumni network to draw upon. We have more than 5,000 alumni spread across a diverse array of industries, including entertainment, supply chain, financial services, and consulting. As a Drucker graduate, you also belong to the 23,000-strong network of alumni from the whole of Claremont Graduate University, which expands your alumni reach in fields like health care, technology, and human resources.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStudying abroad provides students with the knowledge and experience they need to compete in the global marketplace. We offer exchange programs with institutions on three continents and provide additional opportunities through our international intensive programs. In the latter, students study a foreign economy in a specific academic context and then travel abroad for 8 to 12 days to supplement their classroom studies with real-world experiences.\\n\\nRequest more information about the Drucker School of Management\\n\\nAdmissions Representatives\\n\\n*   #### [**Adriana Leake**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/adriana-leake/)\\n    \\n    Assistant Director of Admissions\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-3310\\n    \\n    E: [adriana.leake@cgu.edu](mailto:adriana.leake@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Management, MS in Finance, PhD in Management\\n    \\n*   #### [**Michael Mirabella**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/michael-mirabella/)\\n    \\n    Director of Recruitment for the Drucker School of Management\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-9049\\n    \\n    E: [michael.mirabella@cgu.edu](mailto:michael.mirabella@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Arts Management, MA in Management, MA in Leadership, MS in Finance, PhD in Executive Management, PhD in Management, SOAR\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"FAQ - Drucker School of Management - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/school/faq/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"The Computational Justice Lab (CJL) integrates computer and social sciences to examine issues relating to civil, criminal, and social justice.

And we are all paying the price: Drivers, commuters, cities, the public, and the environment. Motorized individual transport has liberated citizens all around the world. However, today, in many urban areas progress is in reverse gear. One solution is intermodal mobility and specifically integrated public transport, the linking of public transport with micromobility, such as electric scooters, and on-demand shuttles. To be clear, for anything to replace motorized individual transport it must be better. Let\\u2019s face it: In order to change our behavior as consumers, anything new ought to be better than the old.
