A cousin brother of mine had bought a Hobner guitar in Calcutta as he was just beginning to learn. I fiddled with the guitar and was fascinated by its strings and the sounds. I also enrolled under the same tutor. Our teacher was Swapan Chatterjee of Bani Chakra Music School. My first public performance was in front of 100,000 people at Netaji Indoor Stadium where I played on the opening ceremony of the Asian Table Tennis Championship. I still remember that I got Rs 10 for playing on one song. Soon after that, my teacher Swapanda started to introduce me to big musicians in Calcutta and I started to play and record at the All India Radio, Calcutta TV and studios. One day I was playing bass guitar at the Soundwing studios when great composer Hemant Kumar entered the studio. The recording engineer Laltuda whispered in his ears \\u201cWatch this young talent\\u201d. I became more nervous and my hands were sweating. I don\\u2019t think I played that well but it was quite an honor to perform in front of a legend. Later, I recorded in many songs composed by Hemant Kumar.\\u00a0 When I entered engineering school, I formed my first western band called \\u201cEclipse\\u201d. At this time, I learnt western music from Mr. Tutul Ganguly. Our band performed different kinds of songs from Elvis to Pink Floyd. Believe it or not, I played the lead guitar of the famous Wall song at Sanskriti festival at Jadavpur University. It was quite an experience. I have since accompanied many big stars such as Jagjit Singh, Runa Laila, Hoimonti Shukla, Si Tutul, Baby Nazneen, Samina Chowdhury, Suvodeep Mukherjee, Shaheb Chatterjee and Bani Thakur.\\n\\nIn 2017 I composed an album for my wife Madhumita Chatterjee and legendary Bollywood singer Kumar Sanu. In 2020 I am about to release my first New Age album \\u201cStairway to Nirvana\\u201d featuring top musicians from India.\\n\\n**Collaborators:**\\n\\nI have worked with several famous Indian and American musicians. I\\u00a0 was honored to accompany live on stage Ghazal Badshah Jagjit Singh. It was quite a moment. This was 1991 in Orlando concert. I have worked closely with Ustad Aashish Khan (son of legend Ali Akbar Khan Sahib). I have many friends in the Calcutta music circle including Madhu Mukherjee, Rajeeb Chakraborty and Durbadal and Benu Chatterjee, Sanjoy Das, Partha Paul. In the US I have worked with Joey Sommerville (band musician with Prince), Marty Cheyka and Jeff Jusial (back up for Steely Dan). These days I do recording in my home studio and compose songs for my wife Madhumita and friends. My wife is an accomplished singer and music teacher.\\n\\n**Sample Music**:\\n\\nFor more music please visit my wife\\u2019s website at [madhumitachatterjee.com](http://www.madhumitachatterjee.com/)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Hobby / Music \\u2014 Samir Chatterjee\", \"url\": \"https://scholar.cgu.edu/samir-chatterjee/home/hobby-music/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Claremont Graduate University welcomes international students from all over the world.

I am particularly interested in researching the \\u201cPassion and Purpose\\u201d component of the LeAD 6P leadership model and the motivational processes behind leadership development. Great leaders can make an enormous impact in their organization and may even inspire a whole new generation of leaders. So how must one see oneself as such a leader? What makes someone want to become a leader? How would someone go about developing into an influential leader, and what are the reasons for wanting to become such a high impact leader in the first place?\\n\\nI propose that people aspire to become leaders mainly for either intrinsic or extrinsic reasons. Intrinsic reasons include a desire to grow as well as interest in changing some aspect of one\\u2019s environment. The desire to learn and grow comes from the realization that growth is both necessary and enjoyable. Complex and challenging activities, along with effective and constructive feedback, can encourage a person to grow. Developing one\\u2019s own leadership abilities can be fun, and growing as a leader can be rewarding because of the benefits of higher intrinsic rewards such as well-being, and the intrinsic motivation of wanting to improve one\\u2019s surroundings. Such intrinsic motivation includes leading to help improve the lives of others \\u2013 accomplishing an objective for others is rewarding in and of itself. Servant leadership and authentic leadership are examples of the intrinsic desire to lead.\\n\\nLeaders can also develop for extrinsic reasons. Such extrinsic reasons include, but are not limited to, social connections, for gaining or avoiding a certain outcome, economic benefits, as well as desire for power. The desire to learn and grow from an external standpoint comes from the awareness of one\\u2019s social standing in a particular environment. External rewards and recognition can encourage a person to grow. Developing one\\u2019s own leadership abilities can be rewarding due to the benefits of recognition, higher extrinsic rewards such as higher status, and the extrinsic motivation of wanting to have more influence in one\\u2019s surroundings. Such motivation has outer motives and accomplishing an objective with a group is for a particular purpose. Charismatic leadership and transactional leadership are examples of the extrinsic desire to lead.\\n\\nThe passion and purpose of leading can originate from intrinsic or extrinsic motives. What fuels a leader\\u2019s passion to lead and why a leader chooses to lead in the first place may be for primarily intrinsic reasons, extrinsic reasons, or a balanced combination of the two. This is important because those who lead for extrinsic reasons may no longer have the desire to lead once their extrinsic goal has been fulfilled. They must constantly fuel their purpose by creating new extrinsic goals. While this may seem like a good strategy for goal setting, it can create a feeling of emptiness once goals are reached. This often comes in the form of: \\u201cOk, so now what?\\u201d Intrinsically motivated leaders, however, do not have that problem. Intrinsically motivated leaders have the passion and purpose that extends beyond the immediate external goal for leading. Their desire to lead is like a well that overflows for the passion for leading others to achieve a mission, and their intrinsic desire to lead does not dry out once that goal has been fulfilled. This intrinsic motivation fuels a leader to move beyond the leadership demands that their current situation calls for, which means that intrinsic motivation is a more enduring form of motivation that can propel one to lead effectively.\\n\\nHave you uncovered your intrinsic motivations to lead? What beyond the extrinsic trappings of leadership motivates you to be a leader?\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n_[Steven Zarian](http://www.leadlabs.org/about-lead/lead-team-members-2/steven-zarian/) is a first year MA student at Claremont Graduate University.

The possibility of applying interpolation techniques to approximation theory was initiated by Jaak Peetre in 1963. The main realization starts with recognizing that under some mild conditions (namely the inequalities of Jackson and Bernstein are satisfied), every approximation space is a real interpolation space. This means that the K-method of real interpolation theory becomes available as a tool in approximation theory, which can then be used to obtain, for example, Bernstein and Jackson theorems concerning the best approximation of functions in $L\\\\_{p}(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by entire functions of exponential type, approximation of compact operators by operators of finite rank, approximation of differential operators by difference operators.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nAsuman Aksoy (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Image 6: David Kogan](https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2021/12/David-Kogan-150px.png)\\n\\n##### Title of PhD Thesis\\n\\n**On the Average Coherence of Lattices**  \\nCoherence is a measure of non-orthogonality in signal processing. Recently, my advisor applied this concept to lattices. The reason for this is that some other measures of non-orthogonality are directly linked to lattice packing density, an important research question in many applied fields. A related measure of non-orthogonality is average coherence, which we introduce to lattices for the first time. Additionally, we investigate various geometric properties of several different important classes of arithmetic lattices with a general view towards maximal and average coherence, as well as some related parameters.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nLenny Fukshansky (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Image 7: Sina Zareian](https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2021/12/Sina-Zareian-150px.png)\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Title\\n\\n**Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution of the Traffic Flow Partial Differential Equation on Multi-Lane Freeways**  \\nIn mathematics and transportation engineering, traffic flow is the study of interactions between travellers (drivers, and their vehicles) and infrastructure (including highways and traffic control devices), with the aim of understanding and developing an optimal transport network with efficient movement of traffic and minimal traffic congestion problems.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nHenry Schellhorn (CGU)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### **Preston D.

By a celebrated result of Matiyasevich, such an algorithm does not exist in general. On the other hand, for linear Diophantine equations solutions are classically given by the Euclidean algorithm. Further, there are also known algorithms for quadratic polynomials. An important approach to the problem of finding such algorithms over rings and fields of arithmetic interest for different classes of polynomials is through the use of search bounds with respect to height, a standard measure of arithmetic complexity. We study the existence of search bounds on height of solutions for large classes of multilinear polynomials. This research direction also has natural connections to the problem of extending a unimodular matrix to a matrix in GL\\\\_n.\\n\\n##### PhD Research Adviser\\n\\nLenny Fukshansky (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Title\\n\\n**Force Regulation in Contractile Cells by Chemical and Mechanical Signaling**  \\nContractile cells, such as heart cells and epithelial cells, generate force that has implications in health and disease.

We use computational models to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular processes that regulate force in contractile cells.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nParag Katira (SDSU)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Institute of Mathematical Sciences\", \"url\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research\"}}"]
