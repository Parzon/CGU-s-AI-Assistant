A cousin brother of mine had bought a Hobner guitar in Calcutta as he was just beginning to learn. I fiddled with the guitar and was fascinated by its strings and the sounds. I also enrolled under the same tutor. Our teacher was Swapan Chatterjee of Bani Chakra Music School. My first public performance was in front of 100,000 people at Netaji Indoor Stadium where I played on the opening ceremony of the Asian Table Tennis Championship. I still remember that I got Rs 10 for playing on one song. Soon after that, my teacher Swapanda started to introduce me to big musicians in Calcutta and I started to play and record at the All India Radio, Calcutta TV and studios. One day I was playing bass guitar at the Soundwing studios when great composer Hemant Kumar entered the studio. The recording engineer Laltuda whispered in his ears \\u201cWatch this young talent\\u201d. I became more nervous and my hands were sweating. I don\\u2019t think I played that well but it was quite an honor to perform in front of a legend. Later, I recorded in many songs composed by Hemant Kumar.\\u00a0 When I entered engineering school, I formed my first western band called \\u201cEclipse\\u201d. At this time, I learnt western music from Mr. Tutul Ganguly. Our band performed different kinds of songs from Elvis to Pink Floyd. Believe it or not, I played the lead guitar of the famous Wall song at Sanskriti festival at Jadavpur University. It was quite an experience. I have since accompanied many big stars such as Jagjit Singh, Runa Laila, Hoimonti Shukla, Si Tutul, Baby Nazneen, Samina Chowdhury, Suvodeep Mukherjee, Shaheb Chatterjee and Bani Thakur.\\n\\nIn 2017 I composed an album for my wife Madhumita Chatterjee and legendary Bollywood singer Kumar Sanu. In 2020 I am about to release my first New Age album \\u201cStairway to Nirvana\\u201d featuring top musicians from India.\\n\\n**Collaborators:**\\n\\nI have worked with several famous Indian and American musicians. I\\u00a0 was honored to accompany live on stage Ghazal Badshah Jagjit Singh. It was quite a moment. This was 1991 in Orlando concert. I have worked closely with Ustad Aashish Khan (son of legend Ali Akbar Khan Sahib). I have many friends in the Calcutta music circle including Madhu Mukherjee, Rajeeb Chakraborty and Durbadal and Benu Chatterjee, Sanjoy Das, Partha Paul. In the US I have worked with Joey Sommerville (band musician with Prince), Marty Cheyka and Jeff Jusial (back up for Steely Dan). These days I do recording in my home studio and compose songs for my wife Madhumita and friends. My wife is an accomplished singer and music teacher.\\n\\n**Sample Music**:\\n\\nFor more music please visit my wife\\u2019s website at [madhumitachatterjee.com](http://www.madhumitachatterjee.com/)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Hobby / Music \\u2014 Samir Chatterjee\", \"source\": \"https://scholar.cgu.edu/samir-chatterjee/home/hobby-music/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Claremont Graduate University welcomes international students from all over the world.

I am particularly interested in researching the \\u201cPassion and Purpose\\u201d component of the LeAD 6P leadership model and the motivational processes behind leadership development. Great leaders can make an enormous impact in their organization and may even inspire a whole new generation of leaders. So how must one see oneself as such a leader? What makes someone want to become a leader? How would someone go about developing into an influential leader, and what are the reasons for wanting to become such a high impact leader in the first place?\\n\\nI propose that people aspire to become leaders mainly for either intrinsic or extrinsic reasons. Intrinsic reasons include a desire to grow as well as interest in changing some aspect of one\\u2019s environment. The desire to learn and grow comes from the realization that growth is both necessary and enjoyable. Complex and challenging activities, along with effective and constructive feedback, can encourage a person to grow. Developing one\\u2019s own leadership abilities can be fun, and growing as a leader can be rewarding because of the benefits of higher intrinsic rewards such as well-being, and the intrinsic motivation of wanting to improve one\\u2019s surroundings. Such intrinsic motivation includes leading to help improve the lives of others \\u2013 accomplishing an objective for others is rewarding in and of itself. Servant leadership and authentic leadership are examples of the intrinsic desire to lead.\\n\\nLeaders can also develop for extrinsic reasons. Such extrinsic reasons include, but are not limited to, social connections, for gaining or avoiding a certain outcome, economic benefits, as well as desire for power. The desire to learn and grow from an external standpoint comes from the awareness of one\\u2019s social standing in a particular environment. External rewards and recognition can encourage a person to grow. Developing one\\u2019s own leadership abilities can be rewarding due to the benefits of recognition, higher extrinsic rewards such as higher status, and the extrinsic motivation of wanting to have more influence in one\\u2019s surroundings. Such motivation has outer motives and accomplishing an objective with a group is for a particular purpose. Charismatic leadership and transactional leadership are examples of the extrinsic desire to lead.\\n\\nThe passion and purpose of leading can originate from intrinsic or extrinsic motives. What fuels a leader\\u2019s passion to lead and why a leader chooses to lead in the first place may be for primarily intrinsic reasons, extrinsic reasons, or a balanced combination of the two. This is important because those who lead for extrinsic reasons may no longer have the desire to lead once their extrinsic goal has been fulfilled. They must constantly fuel their purpose by creating new extrinsic goals. While this may seem like a good strategy for goal setting, it can create a feeling of emptiness once goals are reached. This often comes in the form of: \\u201cOk, so now what?\\u201d Intrinsically motivated leaders, however, do not have that problem. Intrinsically motivated leaders have the passion and purpose that extends beyond the immediate external goal for leading. Their desire to lead is like a well that overflows for the passion for leading others to achieve a mission, and their intrinsic desire to lead does not dry out once that goal has been fulfilled. This intrinsic motivation fuels a leader to move beyond the leadership demands that their current situation calls for, which means that intrinsic motivation is a more enduring form of motivation that can propel one to lead effectively.\\n\\nHave you uncovered your intrinsic motivations to lead? What beyond the extrinsic trappings of leadership motivates you to be a leader?\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n_[Steven Zarian](http://www.leadlabs.org/about-lead/lead-team-members-2/steven-zarian/) is a first year MA student at Claremont Graduate University.

The possibility of applying interpolation techniques to approximation theory was initiated by Jaak Peetre in 1963. The main realization starts with recognizing that under some mild conditions (namely the inequalities of Jackson and Bernstein are satisfied), every approximation space is a real interpolation space. This means that the K-method of real interpolation theory becomes available as a tool in approximation theory, which can then be used to obtain, for example, Bernstein and Jackson theorems concerning the best approximation of functions in $L\\\\_{p}(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by entire functions of exponential type, approximation of compact operators by operators of finite rank, approximation of differential operators by difference operators.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nAsuman Aksoy (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Image 6: David Kogan](https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2021/12/David-Kogan-150px.png)\\n\\n##### Title of PhD Thesis\\n\\n**On the Average Coherence of Lattices**  \\nCoherence is a measure of non-orthogonality in signal processing. Recently, my advisor applied this concept to lattices. The reason for this is that some other measures of non-orthogonality are directly linked to lattice packing density, an important research question in many applied fields. A related measure of non-orthogonality is average coherence, which we introduce to lattices for the first time. Additionally, we investigate various geometric properties of several different important classes of arithmetic lattices with a general view towards maximal and average coherence, as well as some related parameters.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nLenny Fukshansky (CMC)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Image 7: Sina Zareian](https://research.cgu.edu/ims-students-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2021/12/Sina-Zareian-150px.png)\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Title\\n\\n**Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution of the Traffic Flow Partial Differential Equation on Multi-Lane Freeways**  \\nIn mathematics and transportation engineering, traffic flow is the study of interactions between travellers (drivers, and their vehicles) and infrastructure (including highways and traffic control devices), with the aim of understanding and developing an optimal transport network with efficient movement of traffic and minimal traffic congestion problems.\\n\\n##### PhD Thesis Adviser\\n\\nHenry Schellhorn (CGU)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### **Preston D.

By a celebrated result of Matiyasevich, such an algorithm does not exist in general. On the other hand, for linear Diophantine equations solutions are classically given by the Euclidean algorithm. Further, there are also known algorithms for quadratic polynomials. An important approach to the problem of finding such algorithms over rings and fields of arithmetic interest for different classes of polynomials is through the use of search bounds with respect to height, a standard measure of arithmetic complexity. We study the existence of search bounds on height of solutions for large classes of multilinear polynomials.

Gym memberships, Jenny Craig enrollment, calorie tracker app but no weight loss or healthy progress. This phenomena of wanting to change, making efforts, and not progressing is common. It is a trend also found in organizations. Organizations desire to develop their leaders, they seek to continuously grow their leaders, they create programs and interventions, but see no developmental progress. Famous organizational psychologist, Bruce Avolio and Sean Hannah, propose that the gap between wanting to change and actually changing is an individual\\u2019s developmental readiness.\\n\\nDevelopmental readiness captures an individual\\u2019s motivation and ability to develop. When a person has high motivation to develop (high confidence in developing, high interest and goals, and a learning goal orientation) and high ability to develop (self-awareness, self-identity, and meta-cognitive ability) they are able to cross that gap between wanting to change and making a change. There are a total of six states that make up developmental readiness: three for motivation and three for ability. One of these six states, confidence, will be discussed in this article. Increasing confidence can allow for the other five states to increase as a result and will provide overall resilience and optimism on the journey of development.\\n\\nConfidence, or efficacy is the belief of being capable of a specific task, in this case the task is leader development. Research has shown there are four ways to increase confidence:\\n\\n1.  Prior success\\n2.  Social persuasion\\n3.  Arousal\\n4.  Vicarious learning\\n\\nPrior Success\\n-------------\\n\\nPast performance in successfully developing a new skill can increase efficacy. For example, I have experienced past success in driving. I have never been in a wreck and never received a ticket. I have high confidence in my driving ability because of my past performance. However, in the past I have received great criticism on my reading and writing ability. My grade school teachers would mock and criticize my performance in front of my peers and in private. As a result my confidence in reading and writing has been low. This makes me less motivated to complete reading and writing tasks and I have a lower ability to see positive results. In 2013 researchers, Sitzmann and Yeo found that past performance has an extremely high effect on self-efficacy. But hope is not lost if past performances aren\\u2019t soaked in success! To increase confidence I look at my past in reading and writing and analyze the reason for failure that was in my control and out of my control. I did not read or write a lot as a child so that could be the cause of my past failure. Reading and writing is in my control and I can increase in those activities to ensure future success. My teachers being mean is another factor for my failure in reading and writing, which is not in my control. Understanding the reason for my past failure has allowed me to increase my confidence. I see that although I did not succeed in the past I can and will in the future.\\n\\nList two prior performances that were successful and two prior performances that were failures. Try to determine your area of control over each experience. Some prior failures were only failures because of circumstances that were out of your control. Or perhaps they were failures because of something in your control that you can change in the future. Try to approach this exercise with honesty (telling yourself you did nothing wrong when you actually did have some control over the situation isn\\u2019t helpful to your development). At the end of this exercise, you should be a little bit better at identifying how much control you have over experiences as well as have confidence in your ability to improve in the future.\\n\\nSocial Persuasion\\n-----------------\\n\\nReceiving encouraging feedback from respected supervisors or peers can increase efficacy. As I continue to work on my reading and writing ability, I seek feedback from my classmates and professors. Their feedback although not always positive provides me with support and assurance that I will be a successful writer. Social persuasion happens often in informal ways. The causal comments we get from peers can persuade us to have more confidence in that area. For example, after I deliver presentations, my peers tell me how great I did and tell me how great I would be on TV. These comments are causal but impactful and increase my confidence in speaking in front of others.\\n\\nTry reaching out to your supervisor, subordinates, and colleagues to solicit feedback on a recent project. Let the comments sink into your consciousness and start to self-identify all the times you use the strengths that your peers identified.\\n\\nArousal\\n-------\\n\\nArousal is the factor that contributes least to self-efficacy. Arousal can be in form of heartbeats or sweaty palms. These physiological feedbacks aids in our beliefs about that task.\\n\\nTry to notice times throughout the day and in specific situations where you experience physical changes in your body. Changes in mood or heart rate are good indicators to note. Continue this activity for a week and you\\u2019ll start to have a clearer picture of the activities that give you energy and activities that drain you.\\n\\nVicarious Learning\\n------------------\\n\\nVicarious learning is learning through observing others\\u2019 behaviors and consequences. Before students are able to drive on the road they might watch videos of bad and good driving to increase their awareness and confidence in that task. Vicarious learning can be obtained through viewing a role model. We view the actions and consequences of that person to gain understanding. If you want to be a famous singer, we might look to the behaviors and habits of Beyonce or Taylor Swift.\\n\\nTake a week to think of leaders that you have seen get promotions or show great growth. Once you have identified a few, ask them if they will be willing to engage in an informational interview and start to look at how they develop as leaders.\\n\\nWe have the ability to increase our confidence. When we have high confidence, we are one-step closer to reaching our goals and dreams. To increase our confidence we use prior success, social persuasion, arousal, and vicarious learning. To become increasingly aware of these factors in your life, start writing a story of your life. Crave 30 minutes in your day to reflect on prominent events in the past. You will be able to see patterns and highlight why you are confident in one aware and lack confidence in another.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n_[Amber Kea-Edwards](http://www.leadlabs.org/about-lead/lead-team-members-2/amber-kea-edwards/) is a doctoral student at Claremont Graduate University with a concentration in leader development.

She is known for turning her witty eye on the male-centric world of Modernism and for making radical incursions into the canon of art history by reconfiguring famous works. She falls under a multitude of headings: feminist, appropriationist, post-minimalist, conceptual artist, and conceptual sculptor. Labels aside, her work has contributed to a ground-breaking reconceptualization of the feminist position.\\n\\nLachowicz was born in San Francisco, California, in 1964 and received her BFA from California Institute of the Arts. Her professional history covers more than\\u00a025 years of conceptual art making, and her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Orange County Museum of Art, the Palm Springs Museum of Art, the Museum Moderner Kunst, Palais Lichtenstein in Vienna, and the Bronx Museum of the Arts. She is a recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation award.\\n\\nThe term \\u201clipstick feminist\\u201d grew out of a 1980s\\u20131990s philosophy but, more specifically, the art world came to use that term to refer to the work of Rachel Lachowicz, among a few others. She explores the relationship of identity and the politics of mark-making, predominately through the use of cosmetics. Lachowicz makes both discreet objects and large-scale installations that are visually lush and at times sexually provocative, always with a deliberate repurposing of meaning.\\n\\nLachowicz has more than\\u00a020 years of teaching experience at the graduate level, and her lecture r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 is extensive.

By this time, Drucker had already led several different lives: first fleeing the Nazis in Germany due to his critical journalism, then working in London as a bank economist, and finally residing in New York and Vermont where he held professorships in philosophy, politics, and management. Despite his numerous accomplishments, it was only after arriving at CGU that he embarked on his most productive phase. It was during this period that he produced the majority of his prolific writing and founded the school that now bears his name.\\n\\nWhat Drucker discovered at CGU \\u2014 the freedom to explore both new and established interests and the opportunity to develop ideas that would revolutionize business and society in the 21st Century \\u2014 is what SOAR now offers to successful people seeking their next journey. With a foundation firmly rooted in both the liberal arts and business, CGU and the Drucker School of Management offer SOAR fellows the chance to embark on a new chapter of their lives, emphasizing personal development, societal impact, and transformative education. If you, like Peter Drucker, envision the most productive years of your life still ahead, SOAR can help you connect with your purpose and start afresh.\\n\\nWhat Comes After Success?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nWith significant emphasis on \\u201cmaking it\\u201d in their career, many accomplished people experience a sense of loss following their achievements, accompanied by a lack of direction in navigating their future. Through SOAR, you will discover new pathways to meaning, community, and purpose within the unique learning environment of Claremont Graduate University, an institution focused solely on graduate-level education:\\n\\n##### Personal development + education + community of learners = the path to reinvention\\n\\nAt Claremont Graduate University, we firmly believe in the power of thoughtful transition. When your career trajectory shifts or comes to an end, and you\\u2019re seeking a new journey to embark on, it\\u2019s time to join the path to personal revitalization. SOAR provides fellows with the opportunity to Seek, Observe, Act, and Renew, empowering them to make creative decisions about the next steps in their lives.\\n\\nTogether with your SOAR peers, you will experience the energizing effects of interpersonal exchanges. With a built-in community of individuals, you\\u2019ll feel the camaraderie that comes from exploring new interests and learning from world class professors and lecturers in a safe environment to think, consider, be vulnerable, and feel supported.\\n\\nSocietal Impact\\n---------------\\n\\nThe SOAR program enables people to connect themselves and their journey to the complex challenges facing our world. Participants will engage in activities that allow them to explore their passions, learn about critical challenges facing the world, have an immediate impact, and begin to craft what they want to do next. Our collective interest in Societal Impact will be supported by the SOAR curriculum as well as speakers and general networking opportunities.\\n\\nTime Commitment\\n---------------\\n\\nThe SOAR Program is three sessions covering all described material.

SOAR offers thoughtful perspectives across a variety of disciplines, with curriculum built around reflection, life design, self-development, and purpose.\\n\\n*   **Museum of Me** explores how museums tell stories as an entry point to tell your own story. You will reflect on your own personal narrative and then, like a curator, tell that story through objects in a way that considers how the audience will interpret you. We will ask you to delve into what stories you have told in the past, what you believe, what you have accomplished, what story you want to tell now, and what story you might want to tell in the future.\\n*   **Great Questions** uses books, texts, and poems to engage with some of the timeless questions that shape the human journey: What is truth? How do you know it? What is forgiveness? What is loss? What is joy? What is wonder? What does it mean to be a person? What is a life well-lived?\\n*   **Transitions** uncovers the predictable emotions and challenges of change. You will consider your own relationship with change and learn the tools and mindsets to navigate any transition with awareness, patience, positivity, and intention. This course helps you to integrate your life up until this point and prepare to move forward into your next phase.\\n*   **Purpose and Impact** helps you cultivate your own sense of purpose \\u2014 finding the intersection between what you care about, what you are good at, and what the world needs \\u2013 and ultimately define what you want your next contribution to be.\\n*   **Design Your Life** brings you into the present moment to create awareness of what drives you and what gives you energy. With this foundation, you will apply design thinking tools and approaches as you generate and experiment with different ideas for what you want to grow into next.\\n\\nFor a SOAR podcast and video, see  \\n[Reinventing Yourself In Retirement With Steve Tarr](https://www.retiresoonerteam.com/podcasts/192-reinventing-yourself-in-retirement-with-steve-tarr/)  \\n(please note the dates, below, have been updated)\\n\\nApplication Guidelines\\n----------------------\\n\\n### Requirements Summary\\n\\n| Item | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Statement of Purpose | Yes |\\n| Resume | Yes |\\n\\n#### SOAR Program Admission Guidelines\\n\\nThe admission process for the SOAR Program will focus on admitting qualified individual fellows who will gain from the program, while also building a cohort of diverse fellows who will learn and benefit from each other.

in 1983 to help facilitate research amongst graduate students and faculty in CGU\\u2019s programs in international money and finance, international economic and development policy, global commerce and finance, and international political economy. Since that time, the Institute has grown in both size and scope, and it now has a large number of research associates located across the world who are engaged in collaborative research. While the emphasis of the Institute\\u2019s work remains heavily on aspects of international money and financial economics, its research portfolio covers many aspects of economic policy. CIEPS\\u2019s activities are administered by Directors, Thomas D. Willett and Graham Bird, and a distinguished advisory council.\\n\\nWhile largely applied in nature, research at CIEPS is based on the belief that such analysis must rest on firm theoretical foundations. However, no one theory or methodological approach is best for all situations. As a consequence of this philosophy, the work of the Institute draws both on conventional assumptions regarding rational agents and on more recent developments in behavioral economics. It recognizes important aspects of political economy as well as institutional design in formulating policy. In addition to using modern econometric techniques to analyze large data sets that have often been assembled by CIEPS itself, the research of the Institute also sees a place for carefully crafted case studies that add depth, nuances and richness to large sample analysis. Quantitative and qualitative research methodologies are viewed as being complementary. A particular focus of CIEPS has been the integration of economic and political analysis, and the Institute has played a leading role in developing the field of international political economy. Through its research, CIEPS has had a discernible impact on economic policy at both national and international levels.\\n\\nResearch conducted by members of CIEPS is regularly published in leading academic journals, and the Institute has gained an international reputation both for its high quality research and for its role as a leader in promoting work that crosses conventional disciplinary boundaries, with a special focus being on political economy, behavioral considerations and the role of institutions. Conventional academic metrics, such as citations, reflect the high rate of research productivity achieved by members of the Institute, and the strong impact that this research has had both on academic developments in the field of international money and finance and on the design of economic policy world-wide. Members of CIEPS are frequently invited to give presentations based on their research to meetings of policy makers at national, regional and global levels.\\n\\nCIEPS strongly encourages and facilitates collaborative research between its faculty members, its wide network of research associates, and the large number of doctoral students working in the field of international money and finance. At any one time, there are normally about thirty five students undertaking doctoral study in an area of research covered by CIEPS. The Institute is particularly proud of the way in which it helps to train the next generation of researchers, many of whom have gone on to secure positions throughout the world in academia, government economic service and international organizations, as well as the private sector.\\n\\nCIEPS sponsors a bi-weekly research workshop that analyzes current topics in international monetary and financial economics, as well as domestic economic policy in advanced, emerging and developing economies. It also organizes seminars and an annual student-faculty conference. It regularly arranges sessions at international conferences run by professional associations. By participating in such events, members of CIEPS are able to present their research and disseminate their findings to a global audience of fellow researchers and practitioners.\\n\\nCurrent and recent research projects include:\\n\\n*   Exchange rate regimes and currency areas.\\n*   Economic and political determinants of financial and economic crises.\\n*   International capital flows, surges, reversals and sudden stops: causes and consequences.\\n*   International financial markets, credit booms and banking crises.\\n*   The political economy of the IMF.\\n*   The financing of economic development; foreign aid, remittances and FDI.\\n*   Macroeconomic policy, international interdependence and the trilemma.\\n*   Contagion from financial crises; where, when and why.\\n*   The performance of financial markets; market efficiency versus behavioral finance.\\n*   Issues in international and comparative political economy.\\n*   China, emerging economies and the global economy.\\n\\n_Further information about CIEPS may be gained by using the links to: [Areas of On-Going Research and Selected Recent Publications](https://research.cgu.edu/economic-policy-studies/research/); and [Workshops, Conferences and News](https://research.cgu.edu/economic-policy-studies/conferences-workshops-and-news/)._\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Claremont Institute for Economic Policy Studies\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/economic-policy-studies\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"TRIBUTES\\n\\n[![Image 1: CAROLYN BURRELL BUCK](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-tribute-Buck-400x400.jpg)](https://flame.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-winter-tribute-Buck.jpg)\\n\\nCAROLYN BURRELL BUCK  \\nPhD, Education, 2003\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nBorn on October 12, 1948, in Benham, Kentucky, Carolyn Buck was the eldest of five children.

He was 84.  \\nBorn in Berea, Kentucky, Parks attended Washington Lee High School in Arlington (Warren Beatty was a classmate), and then went on to attend several higher education institutions\\u2014including Rutgers University and Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland\\u2014before receiving a bachelor\\u2019s degree in English Literature from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\\n\\nAfter marrying his wife Julia, who received a degree in nursing from Duke University, Parks rented a small studio and gallery space. He hung a shingle on the front door\\u2014it read \\u201cPoet, Potter, Peacemaker\\u201d (these were the early days of the Vietnam War)\\u2014and committed himself to the craft of pottery in earnest.\\n\\nIn 1963 Parks was accepted into the ceramics program at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School), directed by renowned ceramic artist Paul Soldner. During his time at CGS, Parks worked with famed sculptor John Mason.\\n\\nParks taught at several schools, including Knox College in Illinois and Pitzer College (where he was hired to establish, direct, and teach ceramics and sculpture). However, a visit to a ghost town called Tuscarora in northeastern Nevada resulted in his involvement in creating what came to be known as the Tuscarora Pottery School. Today the academy continues to serve as, according to the school\\u2019s website, \\u201can environment of kinship, community, and creativity through the education and immersion of working with clay.\\u201d\\n\\nBy the late 1990s, Parks\\u2019s son Ben took over the directorship of the pottery school, with Parks serving as professor emeritus.

She was 89.\\n\\nGrowing up in an artistic atmosphere cultivated by her mother, an art administrator in the Alhambra Unified School District, Gates received three scholarships to study art as an undergraduate at Pomona College. In 1954, she graduated with an MFA from CGU (then known as Claremont Graduate School). She studied with some of the region\\u2019s most renowned artists, including Millard Sheets, Milford Zornes, Phil Dike, Rupert Deese, and Rick Petterson.\\n\\nIn addition to raising an extended family in Claremont, Gates taught art at Claremont Collegiate School, a nearby small private high school.\\u00a0During the 14 years Gates lived in Claremont, she focused primarily on her talent as a ceramicist, often making pots and glazes from locally sourced materials, including clay that she dug from the foothills near her home.\\n\\nGates was also a talented painter in oils and acrylics and was a watercolor artist who managed her art business for over 40 years and whose work is represented in private and corporate collections worldwide, including the Kailia Tower in the Hilton Hotel in Waikiki.\\n\\nIn 1977, Gates and husband Charlie sold their Claremont home and moved aboard a 39-foot Taiwanese-built sailboat in Channel Islands Harbor. They named their ship \\u201cMalua\\u201d (\\u201cSlowly\\u201d in Fijian) and lived in the California harbor for 26 years. (Gates also opened a studio gallery there). They also became partners in a 300-acre property in the Fiji Islands, which became a frequent destination for the couple over the years. Later, Gates and her husband moved to a mobile home park not far from their boat in Oxnard\\u2019s Hollywood Beach.\\n\\nGates is survived by three daughters\\u2013\\u2013Alison Kelly Gates Gabel of Oxnard, Susan Kirsty Gates Alcaraz of Claremont, and Jennifer Elena Gates of Oxnard\\u2013\\u2013her stepson Christopher Peck of St. Bonnet-Elvert, France; grandsons Scott Swanberg of Las Vegas and Brian Swanberg of Federal Way, WA; and two grandchildren\\u2013\\u2013 Kate Swanberg and Justin Stickland.

Our 300 students span multiple program areas ranging from arts management to financial engineering. We rank in the top ten business schools in the nation for percentage of women students and are proud to have 27 countries represented in our classes. Despite this immense diversity, our students are united in their passion for creative leadership and their commitment to Peter Drucker\\u2019s people-oriented management philosophy.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOur faculty members publish in peer-reviewed journals and most work as consultants\\u2014 which means they work on the cutting edge of the current business world. They are also widely recognized for their scholarly acumen and contributions to business theory. For example, Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen earned the International Leadership Association\\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award and Professor Bernie Jaworski was awarded the Mahajan Award from the American Marketing Association. Unlike bigger schools, the Drucker-Ito School provides numerous opportunities for our students to interact with our stellar faculty; indeed, we have a low student to faculty ratio of 10 to 1.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOne of Claremont Graduate University\\u2019s premiere programs, dual degrees offer students the opportunity to earn a second degree in only one to two additional semesters. The MBA is the most popular pairing for the dual degree as it provides the broad management training of the MBA with a thorough specialization in an academic or professional field.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nGraduate school is a significant investment of resources that promises to reward you with significant returns over your lifetime. In recognition of this fact, we recently raised funds to expand our fellowship program and now disperse $500,000 annually to reduce the tuition cost of our students. Indeed, 60 percent of our students receive some level of fellowship (in addition to federal student loan programs available to nearly 100 percent of domestic students).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe\\u00a0experienced staff of the [Drucker Office of Career Strategy](https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/careers/) start working with you before you even come to campus by advising you on your resume and assisting you with your internship search. When you get to campus and go through orientation, we help you complete a Career Map and Action Plan to help you make the most of your education. We are committed to providing you with world-class support and guidance in achieving your career goals.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWe take pride in our notable alumni as well as those who work every day as leaders within major companies such as Disney, ESRI, Mizuho, and Toyota. Our students develop immediately applicable skills that lead not only to career opportunities, but also salary increases. Our alumni in California on average see their incomes increase approximately $40,000 between the first year after graduation and the fifth.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWith its decades-long history of producing leaders, the Drucker School has a strong alumni network to draw upon. We have more than 5,000 alumni spread across a diverse array of industries, including entertainment, supply chain, financial services, and consulting. As a Drucker graduate, you also belong to the 23,000-strong network of alumni from the whole of Claremont Graduate University, which expands your alumni reach in fields like health care, technology, and human resources.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStudying abroad provides students with the knowledge and experience they need to compete in the global marketplace. We offer exchange programs with institutions on three continents and provide additional opportunities through our international intensive programs. In the latter, students study a foreign economy in a specific academic context and then travel abroad for 8 to 12 days to supplement their classroom studies with real-world experiences.\\n\\nRequest more information about the Drucker School of Management\\n\\nAdmissions Representatives\\n\\n*   #### [**Adriana Leake**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/adriana-leake/)\\n    \\n    Assistant Director of Admissions\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-3310\\n    \\n    E: [adriana.leake@cgu.edu](mailto:adriana.leake@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Management, MS in Finance, PhD in Management\\n    \\n*   #### [**Michael Mirabella**](https://www.cgu.edu/people/michael-mirabella/)\\n    \\n    Director of Recruitment for the Drucker School of Management\\n    \\n    T: 909-607-9049\\n    \\n    E: [michael.mirabella@cgu.edu](mailto:michael.mirabella@cgu.edu)\\n    \\n    ##### Programs\\n    \\n    MBA, MA in Arts Management, MA in Management, MA in Leadership, MS in Finance, PhD in Executive Management, PhD in Management, SOAR\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"FAQ - Drucker School of Management - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/school/drucker-school-of-management/faq/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"The ELPE is a tuition-based, comprehensive learning program.

Rodriguez, Rafael A. Jimeno, Sandra P. Garcia, Carlos A. Echeverria-Estrada\\n\\nPolicies to encourage socio-political participation of Latinx immigrants in the United States heavily rely on the primacy of assimilation processes resulting from immigrants\\u2019 exposure to the American political system alone. However, this approach overlooks the potential layers of complexity fostered by pre-immigration factors and how these interact with immigrants\\u2019 experiences in the U.S. We conduct a multinomial logit analysis using data from the 2006 Latino National Survey and emergent research on the impact of pre-immigration experiences to determine what factors can both activate participation and be influenced by institutions and policy makers in the U.S. Though we find that low levels of socio-political participation among Latinx immigrants strongly correlate with low levels of pre-immigration participation, for the outlier cases we analyze what factors contribute to increase participation once in the U.S. Results demonstrate the need for political parties and organizations to increase the long-term investment in young Latinx immigrants.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-02: Political Trust and Native American Electoral Participation: An Analysis of Survey Data from Nevada and South Dakota**\\n\\nJean Schroedel, Aaron Berg, Joseph Dietrich, Javier M. Rodriguez\\n\\nThis research analyzes the impact of political trust on Native American electoral participation, using survey responses from roughly 1,500 Native Americans living in South Dakota and Nevada. The in-person survey taking was conducted at locations in Native communities and with the support of tribal leaders, allowing us to overcome many of the methodological issues that have hampered previous studies. We found much higher levels of electoral participation in tribal elections than in non-tribal elections. Respondents expressed high levels of distrust in nontribal government and voting methods, and this distrust has a surprisingly powerful impact on the decision to participate in nontribal elections. We suggest that historical trauma and ongoing discrimination are the primary causes of distrust among Native Americans and find support for this in the observed differences in levels of trust between South Dakota and Nevada.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-03: Infant and Maternal Mortality Rates and the Political Realignment in the U.S., 1915 \\u2013 2017**\\n\\nJavier M. Rodriguez, Byengseon Bae\\n\\nIt is well-known that health outcomes are largely influenced by social determinants of health that policies impact on. Given the dramatic change in the policies of the two parties since the political realignment of 1964, we hypothesize that there would be different patterns in public health outcomes before and after 1964. Using the methods of de-trending the data and multiple regression models with cross-product terms, we found the different patterns of infant and maternal mortality rates explained by President\\u2019s political party before and after 1964. This result not only affirms the politics hypothesis that social determinants of health are political, but also suggests how to reduce infant and maternal mortality.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-04:**\\u00a0**High Vulnerable Communities and the Affordable Care Act: Health Insurance Coverage Effects, 2010-2018**\\n\\nWei, Ye,\\u00a0Javier M. Rodriguez\\n\\nInitially implemented in 2014 in some U.S. states, the Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) aimed to make health insurance coverage more accessible to the low-income population. This paper aims to quantify the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansions on insurance coverage among racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, single mothers, veterans, and low-education whites\\u2014i.e., the sectors of the population identified with some of the highest healthcare needs. We focus on individuals 18-64 years of age earning 138% or less of the federal poverty level from the American Community Survey, 2010-2018 (n=2,927,402). We use difference-in-differences (DD) and difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) approaches with propensity scores matched comparison groups to estimate pre-post ACA insurance coverage differences between individuals living in states that participated in the ACA Medicaid expansions and those living in non-participating states, and to estimate if such differences vary across subgroups. We find that insurance coverage rates increased for all subgroups; yet, the ACA benefits have not been evenly distributed across them. Low-education whites, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic Native Americans exhibited the highest improvements in insurance coverage. Our results contribute to the understanding of recent trends in racial and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare and the appropriate policy prescriptions to ameliorate them.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-05: The Covid-19 Pandemic, Immigrants, and Minority Communities in the United States.**\\n\\nCarlos Echeverria-Estrada, Javier Rodriguez, Claudia C\\u00e1ceres\\n\\nThe purpose of the present chapter is, to offer a global account of the harmful effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the U.S. society overall and, particularly, on poor, racial and ethnic, and immigrant communities. We describe the current U.S. political context, pre-existing social inequalities, and how they have interacted, resulting in a weak, and many times incongruous, response against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We present a statistical analysis to illustrate how non-white/white residential segregation interacts with the concentration of immigrant communities to produce higher infection rates across U.S. counties. We conclude by offering a summary of possible policy solutions that could be, or could have been, implemented to ameliorate the detrimental economic and health effects of the pandemic.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-06:\\u00a0Daily-life Discrimination, Race, and Health: When Income and Education Don\\u2019t Give You What You Want**\\n\\nJavier M. Rodriguez,\\u00a0Carlos Echeverria-Estrada, Wenlan Miao, Shervin Assari\\n\\nThere is growing evidence on the negative effects of daily-life discrimination on health outcomes and their interactions with indicators of socioeconomic status. However, less has been studied about the role that education and income have on different discriminatory experiences depending on the race of the individual. Using data from the national survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS I) on eight measures of daily-life discrimination experiences and an overall index of discrimination, this study compares the experiences of black and white persons across educational levels and income. We apply seemingly unrelated regressions and generalized linear models to disentangle differential effects of education and income by race. We find that the disparities in the health of black people compared to whites in the United States are substantive and exacerbate in the top cohorts of society. Results show that black people increase their experiences of discrimination as education and income increase. This situation highlights a policy conundrum, given that increasing income and education is a desirable course of action to improve overall health outcomes. Yet, by bluntly doing so, racial disparities in discrimination\\u2014and therefore in health outcomes\\u2014can exacerbate. Policy implications, the role of public-private partnerships and advocacy organizations in successful initiatives to address discrimination in high-education and high-income cohorts, and examples of strategies in the literature are also discussed.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-07: Mortality Rate Trends in the United States by Race, Ethnicity and Education, 1959-2016**\\n\\nJavier M. Rodriguez,\\u00a0Carlos Echeverria-Estrada,\\u00a0Francisco Castrillon,\\u00a0Byengseon Bae, Rixin Wen, Alicia Davis\\n\\nIn this research project we are assembling an analysis-friendly dataset of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rate trends by race, ethnicity, and education in the United States. _Data and methods_. The data are from the Multiple Cause of Death files, the Census Bureau, and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Standard demographic methods are implemented. _Results_. We aim to prescribe policies and public interventions useful to shrink racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-08: Police Fatal Encounters and Birth Outcomes by Race and Ethnicity in California**\\n\\nJavier M. Rodriguez,\\u00a0Carlos Echeverria-Estrada\\n\\nThe purpose of this research is to determine whether police fatal encounters in the United States affect important health outcomes, such as pre-term (PB) and low-weight births (LBW) in the proximate geographic areas surrounding the encounters and discuss policy prescriptions to help diminish the negative birth effects of police fatal encounters.\\n\\nConsidering the existing evidence that critical infant health indicators\\u2013\\u2013PB and LBW\\u2013\\u2013are affected by spillover effects that emanate from contextual stressors, two hypotheses stem: a) Mothers who live in the vicinity of a fatal encounter will register worse rates of PB and LBW after the encounter compared to before the encounter and to mothers who were not living in the immediate vicinity at the time of the encounter; and b) the effect of police fatal encounters will be independent of potential socio-economic and contextual confounders and of established risk factors for PB and LBW. _Data and_ _Methods_. Using individual birth records from California between 2000 and 2016, rigorous statistical and geo-referenced analysis will be conducted to test both hypotheses.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-09: Life Expectancy and Political Voice Among Native American Communities in the United States, 1959-2016**\\n\\nJavier M. Rodriguez, Jean Schroedel, Aaron Berg, Rixin Wen\\n\\nThe purpose of the study is to analyze the effect of differential all-cause mortality rates among Native Americans on their political voice. _Method_. Applying life table simulations on mortality data between 1959 through 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), we will estimate the number of Native American voters who would have survived if they had mortality rates comparable to other racial groups. We will also estimate the probability that these hypothetical survivors would have turned out to vote in recent elections. And finally, we will estimate the political representative effects of eliminating from the possible electorate the political voice of those Native Americans who died prematurely\\u2014e.g., by estimating if their turnout would have changed electoral outcomes.\\n\\n**IPRC-IDR-2019-10: A Policy Approach to Overcome Pre-Immigration Barriers to Participation in the Latino Immigrant Community**\\n\\nJavier M. Rodriguez, Rafael A. Jimeno, Sandra P.

Jimeno,\\u00a0Javier M. Rodriguez, John A. Garcia,\\u00a0Carlos Echeverria-Estrada\\n\\nMuch political behavior research highlights the role of post-immigration experiences in framing Latinx immigrants\\u2019 preferences in the United States. We contend that immigrants\\u2019 pre-migration political socialization also shapes their current views, political engagement, and ideological orientations. Findings from a unique set of 146 interviews on political party choice before and after migration suggest that Latinx immigrants exhibit consistency of political orientations for party choice across borders. In other words, home-country political and ideological orientations help guide choice of U.S. political party. Pre-immigration variables are thus crucial for a more comprehensive assessment of Latinx immigrant political psychology and behavior.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Projects \\u2014 Institute for Democratic Renewal\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/democratic-renewal/iprc/projects/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Gigi Audoma (she/her) leverages 14 years of invaluable experience in higher education in her role as Director of Recruitment at Claremont Graduate University, School of Arts and Humanities.

His research focuses primarily on the history and philosophy of medical and scientific ideas and practices, with particular emphasis on changing conceptions of the human and animal body, life, death, health, explanation, and nature during the early modern period and the rise of experimentation and mechanism as they relate to these concepts. He is similarly interested in historiographical questions and the long reception of the early modern period, especially in recent philosophy, medicine, and popular culture. Manning\\u2019s earliest work addressed the \\u00a017th\\\\-century natural philosopher and mathematician Ren\\u00e9 Descartes, but increasingly he has turned, first, to Descartes\\u2019s transnational reception, how later \\u00a017th\\\\-century Cartesians saw themselves in relation to Descartes, and how they defined the Cartesian legacy, and second, to recovering the importance of medicine to early modern philosophy and science as a vehicle for expanding the sources and voices included in historical scholarship surrounding the so-called \\u201cscientific revolution.\\u201d Manning\\u2019s areas of specialization span early modern philosophy, the history of medicine and the life sciences, medical humanities, and contemporary bioethics.\\n\\nManning holds an AB in philosophy from Harvard University and a PhD in philosophy from the University of Chicago.

Manning is a past associate editor of _HOPOS: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science_ and currently edits the Medicine Section for the _Springer On-line Encyclopedia of Early Modern Philosophy and Science_ while also serving as the book review editor for _Annals of Science_. He splits his time between Early Modern Studies at Claremont Graduate University, the Program in the History of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he is a Visiting Associate Professor, and research at the Huntington Library and Gardens, where he is working on a number of projects including an edited volume on the history of death, the changing grammar of anatomical illustrations, and Descartes\\u2019s reception history.\\n\\nCo-edited with Lisa Jardine. _Testimonies: States of Mind and States of the Body in the Early Modern Period_.

She moved to Hawaii and then Oregon as a child because of her father\\u2019s educational pursuits. She was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, attended BYU, went on a mission, married, and with her husband and children, moved to various locations around the world for her husband\\u2019s work, including Ireland, France, and Singapore. She now resides in New Zealand and is finishing up a master\\u2019s thesis on systemic bias.\\n\\nReflecting on her experience as a Latter-day Saint who has lived all over the world, she sees the global church facing some challenges. In New Zealand, many young single people are leaving the church, she reports, making it that much harder for those young people who would like to stay to do so. She thinks one reason so many are leaving is because there has not been space created for dialogue about the complexities of the tradition, the challenges, and the faith crises that so many are experiencing. She believes that in the United States there is more room for these complicated conversations in Latter-day Saint communities.\\n\\nAs Natasha pursues her work studying systemic bias in New Zealand and specifically, against Maori communities, Natasha is planning to work for positive change in New Zealand. Her attention is particularly focused on young Maori women and what she can do to mentor them. She reports that there is an increasing amount of interest and attention among New Zealanders of European descent to confront the legacies of colonization and to work for justice for indigenous populations.\\n\\n![Image 2: Natasha](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/07/3-Natasha.jpeg)\\n\\nLaie, Hawaii,1969.

Some see it as the survival in our midst of an outmoded, primitive way of thinking, while others accuse its critics of simply being blind to the meaning of religious belief. From a different perspective, the clash between belief and unbelief is not seen as a matter of identifying incoherent systems of thought, but as a clash between different demands made on us by divergent ways of looking at the world. Criticisms will flow between these perspectives. There is, however, another kind of interest in this situation: an interest in giving just characterizations of these different voices, so that the nature of allegiances and oppositions to religion may be better understood.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"1995 Can Religion Be Explained Away? \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/1995-can-religion-explained-away/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Our video archive featuring the speakers in our Decoding the Past series continues to grow!

History Teacher Alli Roper designed this 101 4- episode series for those who know little to nothing about the history of the land and the details of the conflict and are looking for an approachable way to learn about it. The 3 episodes were recorded during August and September 2023:\\n\\n[Part 1 of 3](https://share.transistor.fm/s/c043eb33): \\u00a0This episode covers from 4,000 years ago until 1917 with the Balfour Declaration.\\n\\n[Part 2 of 3:](https://share.transistor.fm/s/ac559754) This episode covers from 1917 to the beginning of 1967.\\n\\n[Part 3 of 3:](https://share.transistor.fm/s/a75b3c71) This episode covers from 1967 (Six Day War) to 2023.\\n\\n[The Middle East Today:](https://share.transistor.fm/s/2b34ee28) Must-Know History & Country Relations. This episode covers the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, European influence in the region, some major historical conflicts from WWII to 2023, and how Middle Eastern countries currently relate to each other, generally. The hope is for those who know little to nothing about the Middle East to have a basic primer that can be used as a springboard for further research.\\n\\n**Past Events**\\n---------------\\n\\nThe DEI committee hosted support events during Fall 2023.

We also acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the multivalent perspectives, feelings, experiences and lives that are connected to this violent conflict and the divisive impacts felt in our communities.\\n\\nWe do not have a playbook or lesson plan to navigate this situation, largely because we often approach violence as a dichotomy in which sides must be taken. However, there is no dichotomous construct to conceptualize suffering or humanity. The only clear dichotomy we recognize is between safety and support and violence and fear. It is our responsibility to provide safe spaces at CGU in which healing discourse and thoughtful understanding can be promoted. As a community, we cannot tolerate holding any space for violence to be celebrated or hatred to be expressed.\\n\\nWe aim to help our community by doing everything we can to provide welcoming and safe spaces, where all perspectives can co-exist and where we can collectively acknowledge pain and grief, while we nurture safety and healing as this violence takes away from our humanity.\\n\\nCGU is a place of learning, where we foster complex conversations using our tools, expertise and sense of community. We facilitate dialogue and the hope that, where we lack words and tools, we can co-create them together.\\u00a0 We also look to our communities as partners; more than ever, CGU needs to adhere to its core value of being a place of learning. As such, the DEI Committee is seeking collaboration with members of the communities involved, including:\\n\\n*   Extending invitations to a Rabbi and an Imam to come to campus and help us listen and learn.\\u00a0\\n\\n*   Initiatives to help develop understanding of the histories and contexts for this situation.\\u00a0\\n\\n*   Safe space sessions with intergroup dialogue (IGD) facilitators (see more information above)\\n\\nPlease [click here](https://cgu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_51jpfYFISROSCH4) to express interest in attending any of these events and receiving more information or sharing resources.\\n\\nWe are also providing supportive resources for those who are struggling with pain and grief (see above).\\n\\nWe have learned something during this time, which is we can lose our humanity in busy schedules, deadlines, responsibilities, confusion and sorrow. We are taking this opportunity to remind ourselves to draw on our humanity, to practice compassion, and to support healing.\\u00a0 We hope that this violence ends soon, and that resolution arrives from a discourse of peace in the face of terrorism and war instead of the discourse of hate, such as that seen in the anti-Palestinian and antisemitic narratives.\\n\\nThese words are to say that we see your pain. That we are listening.\\n\\nHumanity is not a dichotomy.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/equity\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Outright Gift of Cash\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe Power of a Simple Gift\\n--------------------------\\n\\nOne of the easiest and most common ways for you to support Claremont Graduate University is with a gift of cash.

The case method of teaching is only effective when participants have analyzed the case and are prepared to contribute to the class discussion. Students will be \\u201ccold called\\u201d in order to open the case discussion.\\n\\nBoth the quantity of comments (i.e. how many times a student speaks) and, more importantly, the quality of the comments will be taken into account. The quality of your comments will be evaluated using the following criteria:\\n\\n*   Does the comment represent a solid analysis of a case or just a reiteration of case facts?\\n*   Does the comment address the question currently on the floor, or is it way off the mark?\\n*   Does the comment demonstrate an ability to listen to and build from what others have said?\\n*   Is the point made concisely, or is it buried in a long, rambling, diatribe?\\n*   Does the comment move the discussion to an important area or does it just rephrase what has already been said?\\n*   If \\u201ccold called,\\u201d was the student prepared?\\n\\nThe selected student will also hand in a 1-page write-up related to the discussion question or case review.\\n\\n### Group Projects:\\n\\nThe class will organize itself into groups, with each group consisting of three students.\\n\\nWe will need groups to do the following projects:\\n\\n*   Software assignment projects\\n*   The I/T case review\\n*   Advances in IT Presentation\\n\\nThe same grade will be accorded to each group members. A lower grade can be assigned to a group member if the majority of group indicates (which must be done before submitting the work for grading) that this member has been \\u201cfree-riding\\u201d and not contributing to the group\\u2019s work. Such input must be submitted as a peer review along with the submission of the work. Any such input after the work is submitted will NOT be entertained.\\n\\n### I/T Case Review\\n\\nStudents are to select and review a topic of interest in the IT area. A typed summary of the topic (2 pages) will be prepared and presented to the class according to a set timetable. Topics will be either selected by the group or assigned by the instructor, based on the course schedule. Each group will then choose the article as desired. _Articles must be chosen from magazines, journals,_ or _trade press publications that have publication date of year 2000 and beyond._ Some of the more popular IS publications are:\\n\\nCommunications of the ACM,\\n\\nHarvard Business Review,\\n\\nSloan Management Review,\\n\\nPC Week,\\n\\nComputer-world,\\n\\nInformation Week,\\n\\nWired,\\n\\nBusiness Week\\n\\nByte.\\n\\nThe LA Times Publishes \\u201cThe Cutting Edge\\u201d regularly in its Business section. The Wall Street Journal is another source to consult. You might also consult the reference librarians or browse the textbook \\u201cReferences and Bibliography\\u201d sections for other similar publications. Then your group prepares a two-page document that summarizes the article, and describes issues in the article that are relevant to the related topics being addressed in the course syllabus. You may be asked to present your write-up in class.\\n\\n### Advances in I/T Presentation\\n\\nIT is changing at a rapid pace. Keeping abreast of latest technical and management trends is difficult but needed. In this project, each group will select and present a relevant topic that is current and emerging. The purpose of this assignment is\\n\\n*   for you to document your reading of articles relevant to the course syllabus.\\n*   To demonstrate your comprehension of recent advances in I/T and how they affect organizations\\n*   To test your ability to present somewhat complex materials to general audiences.\\n\\n### Presentation\\n\\nStudents will be required to present their topic. The format of the presentation will be a maximum of 15 PowerPoint slides. \\u00a0Your presentation will, usually, describe the major issues described in the article. Following a brief introduction, highlight and discuss the important facts and issues presented in the article. If necessary, even quote from it to further emphasize important issues. When alternatives are discussed, make sure to bring your own ideas. In addition to presenting the facts and your thoughts, try to encourage and lead a class discussion on debated issues. Try to surprise your classmates with additional information that will contribute to their knowledge and increase their familiarity with the relevant issues. When wrapping up the presentation, make sure you highlight again the major issues and problems, as well as the proposed solutions and recommendations. Each group will have 20-25 mins to present including Q/A.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"IS 303 \\u2014 Samir Chatterjee\", \"source\": \"https://scholar.cgu.edu/samir-chatterjee/teaching/is-303/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 665-525 BC  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Egypt  \\n**Provenience Location:** Excavatedin1969byDr.DieterArnold,Dr.JanAssman,GermanArchaeologicalInstitute  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Alleged looting\\n\\n**Nation:**\\n\\n**Location:** Unknown, removed some time after 1977\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\nRelief Fragment from the Tomb of Mutirdis - Relief Fragment from the Tomb of Mutirdis, bearing six lines of inscriptions, including a cartouche of Nitocris\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2008  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2008  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Inquiry/Demand\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Government  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Egypt  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** In Transition  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Bonham's  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United Kingdom  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Private: Company\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\\n\\nBonham's had a false provenance listed in its catalogue of the fragment\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Egyptian Mutirdis Tomb Relief Fragment \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/mutirdis-tomb-relief-fragment/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"At the EDEVAL Lab, we believe every individual has unique capacities and contributions to make to society and this potential is unleashed through education and development.

This eagerly anticipated in-person event, themed \\u201cFrom Surviving to Thriving,\\u201d aims to navigate the journey from adversity to flourishing across all walks of life through the lens of positive psychology. The conference will spotlight the tangible applications of positive psychology, the essentials for achieving our best selves, and the value of cross-disciplinary collaborations. Notably, this year\\u2019s conference will feature research and discussions on evaluation in positive psychology and its application within organizations, offering a prime opportunity to engage, interact, and network with key figures from the Claremont Evaluation Center. Set against the backdrop of the historic University of New Mexico in the culturally rich city of Albuquerque, this gathering is poised to enrich the academic and practical landscape of positive psychology in the western U.S. and beyond, fostering a vibrant community of scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts dedicated to advancing the field.\\n\\n[Conference Information](https://wppanetwork.org/wppa-8th-annual-conference-march-22-24-2024-albequerque-new-mexico-hosted-by-university-of-new-mexico/)\\n\\n### The CEC and TEI are developing upcoming workshops, webinars, and events.\\n\\nStay tuned for further updates.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Evaluation and Applied Research Webinar Series \\u2014 Claremont Evaluation Center\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/claremont-evaluation-center/cec-webinar-series/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"\\u201cThere is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer.\\u201d\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n##### \\u2014 Peter F.

At the Lab, students will learn how to create customers, businesses will acquire new capabilities to transform into customer-centric organizations, and entrepreneurs can speed up the idea-to-product process through agile development to create customers faster.\\n\\nCheck our **[BLOG](https://research.cgu.edu/drucker-customer-lab/blog/) for updates**.\\n\\nThe Lab provides an unbiased, award-winning\\u00a0environment in which graduate students and industry partners learn to quickly\\u00a0implement\\u00a0customer-centered innovation using key building blocks:\\n\\n*   Big and deep data\\n*   Analytics\\u00a0sciences\\n*   Real-life experiments\\n\\nOur Lab participants gain firsthand experience working with telemetry and biometric sensors for data collection, cloud-based machine learning systems for analytics, and app-enabled rapid prototyping toolkits for experiments.\\n\\nIn one example, Evan Howard, a student in CGU\\u2019s dual Master of Science/MBA program with [Art Center College of Design](http://www.artcenter.edu/) in Pasadena, and Oliver Hofstetter, an exchange student from the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en), Switzerland, transformed a traditional key into a \\u201csmart key.\\u201d Instead of searching for the right key on a keychain, a smart key will light up and buzz on approach to the matching door\\u2013particularly helpful with similar-looking keys and in the dark.\\n\\n\\u201cSmart products\\u201d embody the **Internet of Things (IoT)** (Porter & Heppelmann, 2014).

They love coffee but don\\u2019t want to think too much about operating their coffeemakers.\\n\\nDuring this time of great technological advances, they felt that many kitchen appliances, such as coffeemakers, have been been left behind. You can check order status and track packages online, but there isn\\u2019t a way to find out whether you switched off your coffeemaker. So the students decided to turn their coffeemaker into a smart product.\\n\\nThe video shows a phase of an agile development process that utilizes a rapid-prototyping toolkit. You can see the team as it prepares a test of a new customer journey using an interactive prototype. The prototype bears little resemblance with a coffeemaker, because there is nothing wrong with the brewing process itself. Instead the focus is on designing a new user experience and on testing user interaction alternatives using a real sensor (heat), actuators (LED and buzzer) and interaction logic (app on smartphone screen).\\n\\n### Example: Building Recommendation Engines\\n\\n**\\u201cHow to sell more \\u2013 and quickly?\\u201d**\\n\\nRecommendations from family, friends and customers remain the most credible form of advertising among consumers according to the market research experts at Nielsen. So why would any company let someone else solicit and curate customer ratings to provide product recommendations?\\n\\nYet, product ratings and user recommendations are typically left to third parties, such as Amazon or Yelp. Furthermore, nobody knows the product or service better than its maker. In fact, great effort and money is expended explicitly to differentiate an offering. No company should sell its products without recommendations.\\n\\nOur graduate students Afnan Bawakid, Josh Griffith, Alexey Migerkin, and Thomas Slaughter decided to do better. As future product managers they decided to use machine learning to construct a recommendation engine as a group project.\\n\\nThe video illustrates how the team worked strategically as well as hands-on. In terms of strategy the team chose to manage the project using a simplified, 3-step data analytics process that corresponds well with CRISP-DM, a widely used open standard process for data mining applications. Hands-on development was done using Microsoft\\u2019s Azure Machine Learning Studio, a cloud-based development environment, which allowed the team to quickly run exploratory diagnostics and create a first recommendation engine prototype.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Empowering Individuals \\u2014 Drucker Customer Lab\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/drucker-customer-lab/empowering-individuals/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"### Telemedicine & Telehealth\\n\\n**Term:** \\\\[_Spring__, 2012_\\\\]\\n\\n**Campus:** \\\\[_Claremont_\\\\]\\n\\n**Location:** McManus 31\\n\\n**Day(s) & Time:** \\\\[_Saturdays: 1:00 pm \\u2013 4 pm_\\\\]\\n\\n**Instructor:** \\\\[Dr. Samir Chatterjee, Professor\\\\]\\n\\n**Core Faculty Liaison:** \\\\[_\\u2018same\\u2019_\\\\]\\n\\n**Contact Information:**  \\nSchool of Information Systems & Technology  \\nClaremont Graduate University  \\nRoom 224, ACB  \\n[Samir.chatterjee@cgu.edu](mailto:Samir.chatterjee@cgu.edu); [profsamir1@gmail.com](mailto:profsamir1@gmail.com)  \\n909-607-4651  \\n909-730-8898 (cell)\\n\\n_Course Overview_:\\n\\nThis course covers the theory and practice of Telemedicine, Telehealth and E-Health. Telemedicine can be defined as the provision of health care services, clinical information, and education over a distance using telecommunication technology. Telehealth is understood to mean the integration of telecommunication systems into the practice of protecting and promoting health while telemedicine is often restricted to remote consultations between physicians and patients. With the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, the word E-Health has emerged that refers to all forms of electronic health care delivered over the Internet, ranging from informational, educational, and commercial \\u201cproducts\\u201d to direct services offered by professionals, nonprofessionals, businesses or consumers themselves.\\n\\nThis course will cover the necessary content through lectures and supplementary reading materials. The course will have a project focus in which students (individuals or groups) will conduct telemedicine projects on a variety of topics.\\n\\nThis class in the past has always visited a telemedicine clinical site (once to India and another time to Northern California). The students and instructor will take a similar trip which is currently being planned.\\u00a0 This year the entire class will go to Silicon Valley to attend the American Telemedicine Association Annual Meeting 2012 to be held from April 29-May1.\\n\\n_Prerequisites_**:** IS 306 or permission of instructor\\n\\n**Objectives for Student Learning (Course and Program):**\\n\\n<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td colspan=\\\"7\\\" nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">Program Learning Outcomes</td></tr><tr><td>Course Learning Outcomes:</td><td><p>Graduates are prepared to be leaders in the IS field</p></td><td><p>Graduates have core IS knowledge</p></td><td><p>Graduates can integrate IS &amp; business foundations</p></td><td><p>Graduates have perspective on business and real world</p></td><td><p>Graduates have communication, interpersonal, and team skills</p></td><td><p>Graduates are able to think analytically and creatively</p></td><td><p>Graduates have required career-specific skills</p></td></tr><tr><td><b>Upon completion of HIM 378, students will know:</b></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr><tr><td>What telemedicine and Telehealth is</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td></tr><tr><td>How to evaluate different telemedicine applications and systems</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr><tr><td>How to work with vendors of telemedicine</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td></tr><tr><td>How to work with video-conferencing and telemedicine systems</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr><tr><td>What are the security and privacy issues in telehealth</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr><tr><td>How telemedicine is being used in various parts of the world</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr><tr><td>What business models work in telemedicine</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr><tr><td>What are the legal and ethical issues in telehealth</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td></tr><tr><td>How actual clinics are utilizing telemedicine technologies through demonstrations (site visit)</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\">x</td><td nowrap=\\\"nowrap\\\"></td></tr></tbody></table>\\n\\n**_Text and Readings_**:\\n\\n1.

As part of this, and in view of our emphasis on using information technologies, we require that every student in every course must document some aspect of their learning in the course using an e-portfolio.\\u00a0 E\\u2011portfolios must be done with the Claremont Conversation Online.\\n\\n(For more details, see: http://administration.cgu.edu/fac/ryant/use\\\\_the\\\\_CCO\\\\_for\\\\_eportfolios.htm.)\\n\\nTo satisfy this requirement, an entry in the student\\u2019s e-portfolio must be created with the template page for this course, and it must address the learning objectives for the course and program.\\u00a0 These are listed in the matrix above and in the CCO e-portfolio page template for this course.\\n\\nThe instructor will determine whether the entry suitably reflects course- and program-related learning. \\u00a0She/he may ask the student to revise and resubmit the entry. There are many possible suitable entries.\\u00a0 Possible examples include the deliverables for a class project, a paper written as a result of the course, or a series of blog entries.\\u00a0 Any entry is acceptable that demonstrates that the student knows more about the course content than she/he did at the beginning of the course.\\u00a0 It is important that the entry be non-trivial, but it need not be a major new undertaking either.\\u00a0 Entries are intended to be a representation of what was learned.\\n\\nThis is a special assignment.\\u00a0 It is not used in calculation of your course grade; it is a requirement to get a grade.\\u00a0 No final grade other than \\u201cIncomplete\\u201d (except \\u201cUnsatisfactory\\u201d) will be assigned for the course until you have posted a suitable entry to your e-portfolio.\\u00a0 Any e-portfolio entry intended to be used to satisfy the requirement for the course must remain in the student\\u2019s CCO e-portfolio for at least one month following the course, to allow time for archival of pages to occur.\\n\\nBecause entries to an e-portfolio provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your learning, we encourage you to create more than the one required entry, to share your entries with your classmates, and to collect entries across your classes\\u2014in effect, creating a online collection of postings about what you have been learning.\\u00a0 Such collections have value in expressing to yourself and others what you have learned in your degree program.\\n\\n_Grading components_\\n\\n<table><tbody><tr><td><i>Mid-term Exam</i></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Project #1</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Project #2</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Quiz</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Journal paper presentation</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Research Report and presentation</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Blogging experience of the field trip</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Class Participation</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Total (100%)</td><td>100%</td></tr></tbody></table>\\n\\n_Grading scale_\\n\\n<table><tbody><tr><td>97% \\u2013 100%</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>93% \\u2013 96.9%</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>90% \\u2013 92.9%</td><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>87% \\u2013 89.9%</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>83% \\u2013 86.9%</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>80% \\u2013 82.9%</td><td>B-</td></tr><tr><td>77% \\u2013 79.9%</td><td>C+</td></tr><tr><td>73% \\u2013 76.9%</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>70% \\u2013 72.9%</td><td>C-</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 70%</td><td>U</td></tr></tbody></table>\\n\\n_Schedule_ (This is suggested only.

The formation and enactment of habitual behaviors.\\n2.  The use of implementation intentions to guide alternative behaviors in the presence of cues.\\n3.  The influence of neurocognitive processes on behavior.\\n\\nThe intervention itself will be developed through the implementation of five interconnected studies. The first study will identify cues to habitual dietary behavior among adolescents. The second study will create an intervention activity designed to modify inhibitory function. The third study will test cue-based and implementation intention approaches for dietary change. The fourth study will test alternative approaches to the modification of inhibitory function and dietary intake among adolescents. The fifth study will fuse together elements of all the prior studies into a complete intervention with children 14-17 years of age and their families.\\n\\nStudy participants will be identified, screened, and recruited from the patient population of Molina Healthcare clinics in the greater Los Angeles area. Molina Healthcare is a national health maintenance organization that provides health care to 41,000 low-income patients in Southern California.\\n\\nThe data collection methods used across the five studies include self-administered questionnaires, focus group interviews, body measurements, medical record analysis, Ecological Momentary Assessment data, computerized cognitive assessments, observational assessments, and functional MRI.\\n\\nInvestigators\\n-------------\\n\\n![Image 1: Kim Reynold](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2016/11/reynolds3.jpg)  \\n[**Kim Reynolds, PhD**](http://www.cgu.edu/people/kim-d-reynolds/)  \\nPrincipal Investigator  \\nEmail address: [kim.reynolds@cgu.edu](mailto:kim.reynolds@cgu.edu)\\n\\n![Image 2: Susan Ames](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2016/11/ames3.jpg)  \\n[**Susan L.

Cuteness is my philosophy. On one hand, I love the process of mixing colors, matching colors and creating my own fantastic colors by using any tools or materials. I love painting, and I am trying to use different colors to bring people different feelings and emotions. On the other hand, I would like to use my skills and techniques on painting and drawing to create a both abstract and realistic world. Beauty is also important in my art. I like to use my illustration works to tell a story to my audience and to express what I love and hate. I love things that are cute and think that many works in art world embodies loveliness and children\\u2019s hearts somehow. These elements could make the works more unique and individual. Simple and lovely works surely can tell big ideas just like Aesop\\u2019s Fables in which are all short and easy understanding stories but with profound philosophers in them.\\n\\n**Bio**  \\nThe process that I become an \\u201cartist\\u201d is unpredictable. In other words, in many of important transitioning points in my life, I have changed my thoughts and plans many times. What I firmly believe is only when we tried, can we know what we are really fond of. I have two years study in Shanghai Normal University, majoring in environmental design; and graduated from University of La Verne majoring in Studio art. I am also attending the MFA program in Claremont Graduate University.\\n\\nI love cuteness; cuteness is my philosophy. Artists I love and was influenced by are Nara Yoshitomo, Yayoi Kusama, Aya Takano, and Takashi Murakami. I love Nara for his distinctive style and also how he represents the story of his girls. In other words, it is cute but also full of content. For Yayoi, I love her works related to the infinite repetition of a compulsion. The world she created is so crazy and desired.\\n\\nFrom my own perspective, one\\u2019s works are related to their family, growth environment and their own experiences. Art comes from life and experiences; therefore, my works are created from my positive attitude towards life and my own personalities. I hope I can create the works that can make people happy and comfortable; at the same time, I was feeling happy when I made those pieces. Having my own unique style, expressing my ideas through my work, doing whatever I like that can make me happy, free, and relaxed are playing an extremely important role in my art world. I love figurative painting instead of abstracting painting, I hope my works can be more mature during the two years study in Claremont and hope to become a post-modernism artist dealing with pop art.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Xinjie Yin MFA '18 - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/students/xinjie-yin/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: donor-stone-art.jpg](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-stone-art.jpg)\\n\\nCGU student Leslie Love Stone was raised by a mathematician mother and civil-engineer father. She minored in economics and holds an MBA. And as a former bank executive who focused on market research, it may seem odd to see Stone now pursuing a Master of Fine Arts. But rather than abandoning her former mode of thinking in pursuit of a new one, Stone applies mathematical and statistical models to her art.\\n\\n\\\"Every time we create a statistic, we are making a generalization about something that ignores specifics. The cost of this is that the information, by the process of collation, is sterilized, and the human element is lost. By painting these models, my goal is to reanimate that data but in a different form, to reinfuse it with a human principle,\\\" said Stone.\\n\\nStone's art represents the intersection of the analytical and the metaphysical. Typically combining three elements\\u2014a color, a body of statistics, and a random signifier\\u2014 and using both formalist and conceptual\\u2014or interpretive\\u2014techniques, she aims to create meaning where connections aren't ordinarily made.\\n\\nOn December 14, 2012 a mass shooting took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. As information slowly trickled out on the news wires, Stone sensed an unsettling emphasis on the shooter. And that following Monday, when Stone finally got information about the victims, she found it in the form of a spreadsheet that listed only the children's names, ages, and genders.\\n\\nThis led her to question how society processes tragic news: By containing and rationalizing information, is it easier to process grief? By creating a summary of something, is it somehow more manageable? And what happens to the individuals behind the statistics? Where does the \\\"human element\\\" go?\\n\\n\\\"We are always mining the universe for data in an attempt to locate the truth, and where we lack data, we fill in the gaps with interpretation. Even though all I had were names, genders, and birthdays, the children started to come alive for me, and I started to imagine them as individuals,\\\" said Stone. \\\"Take Jack Pinto\\u2014what a cool name! He must have liked that, and I imagined him to be good at sports. And then there is Chase Kowolsky, who was born on Halloween. And I wondered whether at his age he still thought that was cool, or was bummed out about having to share his birthday with a holiday.\\\"\\n\\nStone's installation, They Fill My Eyes, which was on display last January at the Mosaic Gallery in Pomona, consists of 20 paintings using colors derived from the Myosotis arvensis (Forget-Me-Not) and a geometric numbering system. Each piece is painted with Flashe on a 10\\\" x 10\\\" wood panel. The color on each indicates whether the child is a boy or girl (blue or pink). The number of colored segments reflects the child's age. The overall number of segments is placed in eight triangular sections from left to right, top to bottom, and show the child's birth date. The series title is a line taken from the old Marmalade song, \\\"Reflections of My Life.\\\"\\n\\nWhat began as a personal way for Stone to process the event has transformed into a poignant commentary on how we process grief, and how we can infuse raw data with a sense of humanity. And in the same way that the children came alive as individuals for Stone through her painting, she hopes that viewers of the art can experience the same. Patrons were provided with an informational pamphlet showing them how to read the panel.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't have any expectations about how people would respond, but I noticed people spending a lot of time with each panel, counting the numbers, deconstructing, and trying to make meaning the way I had,\\\" said Stone. \\\"This story was written in a language I understand and I felt compelled to translate it.\\\"\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

When a distribution is made from your retirement plan account to a beneficiary, that person will owe federal income tax.\\n\\nConsider leaving your loved ones less heavily taxed assets and leaving your retirement plan assets to Claremont Graduate University to support our work. As a nonprofit organization, we are tax-exempt and will receive the full amount of what you designate to us from your plan. You can take advantage of this gift opportunity in the following ways:\\n\\n[Name us a beneficiary of your plan.](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/beneficiary-designations) This requires you to update your beneficiary designation form through your plan administrator. Here you can designate Claremont Graduate University as the primary beneficiary for a percentage or specific amount. You can also make us the contingent beneficiary so that we will receive the balance of your plan only if your primary beneficiary doesn't survive you.\\n\\n[With the IRA Charitable Rollover](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/ira-charitable-rollover), if you are 70\\u00bd years old or older, you can take advantage of a simple way to help those we serve and receive tax benefits in return. You can give up to $105,000 from your IRA directly to a qualified charity such as Claremont Graduate University without having to pay income taxes on the money.\\n\\n[Set up a charitable gift annuity](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-gift-annuities). If you are 70\\u00bd or older, you may now make a one-time election for a qualified charitable distribution of up to $53,000 (without being taxed) from your IRA to fund a life-income gift. This gift provides you (and a spouse, if you wish) with stable lifetime income that is unaffected by the markets. After your lifetime, the remainder of the gift annuity becomes your legacy at CGU. Some limitations apply, so contact us for more details and a personalized illustration at no obligation.\\n\\nFund a testamentary [charitable remainder trust](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/charitable-remainder-trusts). When you fund a charitable remainder trust with your heavily taxed retirement plan assets, the trust will receive the proceeds of your plan. The trust typically pays income to one or more named beneficiaries for life or for a set term of up to 20 years, after which the remaining assets in the trust would go to support Claremont Graduate University. This gift provides excellent tax and income benefits for you while supporting your family and our work.\\n\\n[A donor advised fund.](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/donor-advised-funds) When retirement plan assets pass to your heirs, distributions are taxed as ordinary income. This income tax burden can be substantial, greatly reducing the value of the intended gift. Instead, you can designate your donor advised fund as the beneficiary of all or a portion of your retirement plan assets. Your fund receives the full amount of the gift and bypasses any federal taxes.\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

When the stay at home order came, we canceled seminary. A few weeks later my co-teacher and I were told to teach seminary via zoom one day a week and have the students do online lessons for the other four days each week. Attendance dropped significantly. Many of the students never made the switch and just stopped coming altogether. One students who had 100% attendance before the pandemic, began coming to the zoom lessons but he hated the online lessons so much he only got a few of them done and now over a year later is still working on making up those attendance days that he missed. It was a struggle using a new program that I had never used before and with an unstable connection. I would often go to the church to teach seminary because there was a better connection there, but many of my students had unstable connections at their homes also. In the fall we were told to teach over zoom one day a week again and have the students do online lessons via canvas. Since online lessons had failed so miserably the year before, I asked if we could do all zoom. We were told to do zoom four days a week and canvas one day. We hoped that it would be temporary and kept waiting for the day we would be able to meet in person, but now almost at the end of the school year, we are still doing zoom and canvas. An entire school year of zoom seminary! We improved our internet connection with a new modem at home, but we have continued to have technological challenges all year long.\\n\\n![Image 1: Port Angeles](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/05/port-angeles-51104_1920.jpg)\\n\\nRecently, I was using breakout rooms on zoom and meant to close the breakout rooms but accidentally ended the whole meeting! Zoom has presented so many challenges, and online lessons so many more challenges! I have learned so many lessons though as a result of these challenges. First, trust God. I love my Heavenly Father so much and know without a doubt that He helped me and my students get through this year! He has been our support and our strength, our rock and our foundation through it all. He loves us and has never left us. He has always been here for us. I know when I ask for His help, He will answer. He always does. I have also learned to trust and follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost. He is always there for me, giving me the words to say and helping me plan my lessons. I\\u2019m so grateful for the gospel! This has been such a learning, growing experience.

Your work in your studio\\u2014and in the world beyond the studio\\u2014is fortified by a framework of courses dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, and experience to succeed in whatever you choose to do as an artist in the rapidly changing world.\\n\\nOur building has been designed to foster a dynamic community of artists, with ample spaces, indoor and out, for the making and display of all forms of art.

We also offer discounted rates for groups 20+ or non-profit organizations.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWe all hold our personal beliefs about what makes a leader effective. These often-implicit beliefs are developed through early experiences with leaders in our lives, like our parents, coaches, teachers, and supervisors. Those beliefs may or may not align with effective leadership and, if not, may be harming our ability to effectively lead. Research on leadership has been accumulating over the past 100 years and organizational scholars have identified through evidence which leadership behaviors drive team and organizational outcomes. The purpose of this workshop is to reconceptualize effective leadership based on the evidence. Through an online self-assessment and feedback report, lecture, and facilitated and group discussion, attendees will learn about the LeAD 6PLeadership Framework. Having terminology and a common understanding of effective leadership can help us identify our strengths as a leader and areas we would like to supplement. Effective leadership behaviors discussed include establishing well-defined roles, processes, and channels of communication (Pathways), behaviors that foster strong connections with team members and create positive contexts for the work being done (People & Place), gathering and applying information to make effective and balanced decisions (Problem-solving), and using inspirational, relational, and rational influence strategies to gain commitment to goals (Positive Persuasion). We will pay special attention to Passion & Purpose and Pursuit. Passion & Purpose answers the question, \\u201cWhy do I lead?\\u201d Having a clear Passion & Purpose can provide meaning, help shape who we are as a leader, and be especially energizing. Finally, the Pursuit dimension concerns our intention in pursuing ongoing development as a leader. Rather than being a weathervane blowing in the wind, we can purposefully engage identifying the experiences unique to our developmental needs, approach those experiences with openness to learning, deeply engage in the experience, and take moments to individually or collaborative reflect on key takeaways. Through Pursuit, we can take the wheel and drive our leader development in the direction we desire.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThis training will cover topics related to conflict management. Specifically, participants in the training will learn what conflict is, why it matters, and what causes conflict, while building their own self-awareness about their conflict triggers and how they operate in conflict. Brief self-reflection will be embedded into the workshop and additional resources will be offered to participants at its conclusion. After learning about conflict management in an interactive webinar, workshop participants will engage in a simulated role-playing activity allowing them to practice the skills they have learned and debrief their experiences. This debrief will be facilitated by LeAD certified coaches, who will support participants as they gain self-awareness and identify areas for further development.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThis workshop walking you through the best practices for making an effective and actionable leader development plan. It will help you understand how to identify leadership strengths and weaknesses, establish powerful goals, design SMART action strategies, and reassess, refine, and realign your goals as you progress in your development. This workshop provides support and guidance for completing the Leader Development Online tool in addition to emphasizing the importance of leader development planning. Workshop content instructs you on what you can do to prioritize your continuous development in your current role and beyond.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFollowing a large group introduction, groups of 4-5 leaders will engage in a group discussion.

The executor or administrator of your estate will not have to take any action to ensure that your account transfers to whomever you designated. Simply ask your bank representative about the one or two easy steps you need to take in order to place a POD designation on your bank account or certificate of deposit.\\n\\n**Transfer on death (TOD).\\\\*** By placing a TOD designation on your brokerage or investment account, that account will be paid over to one or more persons or charities after your lifetime.

We remember him fondly. He was an inspiration and guide for the establishment of the Howard W. Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies.__Armand served as a founding member of the Mormon Studies Council at CGU and taught in CGU\\u2019s Mormon Studies program.

Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies, Claremont Graduate University**\\n\\nI first encountered Armand Mauss\\u2019s\\u00a0_The Angel and the Beehive_in the early years of my graduate school training: I was hunting for some material on contemporary Mormon worship practices, and I found that in his book.\\u00a0But I found a lot more than that as well. \\u00a0Mauss\\u2019s book has now for twenty-five years been the best comprehensive work on twentieth century Mormon history we have. It managed to both be among the first thorough works on the topic, but also to set the parameters and narrative arc that have structured nearly all work on twentieth century Mormon history since. Mauss\\u2019s model of assimilation and retrenchment (and his follow-up works that have extended his interpretation to the periods after the timeframe of the book ends) have proven durable and persuasive to historians working on a wide range of topics. The book has become a firm canopy that has proven able to shelter and anchor a range of research.\\n\\nI\\u2019m convinced the book will remain part of the Mormon studies canon even as the work which follows it transcends it. In part, of course, Mauss pointed the way there himself, with his followup\\u00a0_All Abraham\\u2019s Children_, a study of race and Mormonism which illustrated how many stories beyond the white, male, Utah centers of Mormon power remain to be told. More, we have begun to see Mormon studies branch beyond the historians who have embraced it so far; more and more scholars of multiple disciplines have begun taking the tradition seriously\\u2014and as that has happened, the shelves in the BX8600 section of the library have begun to fill with books both building on and dissenting from\\u00a0_The Angel and the Beehive_\\u2014though all still owe it a debt.\\n\\nAfter I finished my graduate training I got to know Armand personally, and discovered that his rigor, generosity, and imagination characterized him as a mentor, friend, and guide. When I took the Hunter Chair, Armand became one of those figures I consulted with regularly for counsel and encouragement. He will be missed.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**R.

Hunter Foundation**\\n\\nArmand was perhaps the most proactive member of our Mormon Studies Council.\\u00a0 He was also an adjunct professor at Claremont Graduation University, and was very knowledgeable about issues surrounding blacks and the Priesthood.\\u00a0 But Armand\\u2019s influence extended well beyond that.\\u00a0 He was one of the most proactive on our Council on many different topics.\\u00a0 He constantly raised questions about what we were doing to make sure we were doing our best.\\u00a0 He was particularly fond of and protective of our students.\\u00a0 He always tried to get us to be more supportive of students and their economic challenges.\\n\\nHe was heavily involved in fund-raising, and contributed far more than most of us given the differences in our incomes.\\u00a0 He was a watchdog of our finances, and routinely questioned how we dealt with our funds, both from a treasury and a banking standpoint.\\u00a0 I don\\u2019t know if there was anyone who loved and supported the Mormon Studies program at CGU more than Armand.\\u00a0 He will be sorely missed by so many, but his profound influence will live on.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Jana Riess**  \\n**Author of _The Next Mormons_**\\n\\nSince I was trained as a historian and not a social scientist, it was with some trepidation that I told Armand years ago that I was thinking about diving into a large-scale research project about contemporary young Mormons. What became _The Next Mormons_ was possible in no small part because of Armand\\u2019s willing assistance with many aspects of the project, as he offered feedback on early drafts of survey questions, donated to the Kickstarter campaign that funded the national survey, and read and commented on two chapters in progress. That same generosity of spirit was also apparent when we served together on the _Dialogue_ board. Armand was by that time in his late seventies and early eighties.\\n\\nPlenty of other people look at retirement as a time to enjoy a long-earned respite from work, and a chance to indulge personal interests. (Believe me, I\\u2019m not judging.) This was not Armand\\u2019s approach. He devoted himself to the journal and the people associated with it. I count myself as tremendously lucky that our years on the board overlapped. I will miss his keen intellect, vibrant sense of humor, and equally vibrant Hawaiian shirts. God be with him till we meet again.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Christie Frandsen and Amanda Haslam Wirtz**  \\n**Chairs, Mormon Studies Council**\\n\\nThe Mormon Studies Council of Claremont Graduate University joins with the rest of the LDS scholarly community in mourning the passing of our beloved Armand Mauss, the \\u201cfounding father\\u201d of the Mormon Studies program at CGU. He was a giant among LDS scholars and leaves a legacy of ground-breaking and standard-setting work that might never be matched. He was a visionary who saw the powerful good that could come from establishing collegial and personal relationships between LDS scholars and scholars in the broader academy.\\n\\nIt was this vision of his that gave birth to the Howard W. Hunter Foundation and Chair of Mormon Studies at CGU, and it was his indefatigable support that has kept it alive and growing. His energetic, always optimistic, sometimes reproving voice will be profoundly missed but never forgotten at our Council meetings. He was never fond of words of praise, and so we leave him with what he would far rather receive as a tribute at his death: our resolute pledge to continue the great work to which he devoted the last years of his extraordinary life.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Patrick Mason**  \\n**Leonard J. Arrington Chair of Mormon Culture, Utah State University**  \\n**Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies, Claremont Graduate University, 2011-2019**\\n\\nThe academic field of Mormon studies lost one of its greatest pioneers and champions when Armand Lind Mauss passed away. In a field created and dominated over the past half century by\\u00a0American\\u00a0historians, Mauss was Mormon studies\\u2019 preeminent social scientist. He authored a number of influential studies late in his career that transformed the way we think about Mormonism, the Mormon people, and\\u2014somewhat ironically\\u2014Mormonism\\u2019s historical development.\\u00a0He was an energetic and generous supporter of some of the key institutions that provide the intellectual and organizational scaffolding for the field. He was a devoted scholar, teacher, friend, mentor, father, and husband, and will be greatly missed.\\n\\nHaving retired to Orange County, he was in the right place at the right time when Claremont Graduate University began considering the possibility of\\u00a0creating\\u00a0an endowed professorship in Mormon studies.\\n\\nMauss\\u00a0taught the first Mormon studies courses at CGU from 2005-2008, energetically served on the Mormon Studies Council\\u00a0for several years, and was an indispensable part of the establishment and success of the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies.\\n\\nThose who care both about Mormonism and the life of the mind stand on the shoulders of\\u00a0a generation of\\u00a0giants\\u00a0(some of whom, fortunately, are still with us). In Armand Mauss\\u2019s passing, we lose\\u00a0one of these\\u00a0giants, one\\u00a0whose exterior was stern and exacting but whose heart more than filled his large frame.\\u00a0Those of us who knew Armand personally will never forget him, and all of us are in his debt.\\u00a0How will we repay the debt? I think I know what Armand would say: read, think, write, and live honestly. After all, what good is any other way?\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Michael McBride**  \\n**Professor of Economics & Religious Studies, University of California, Irvine**\\n\\nTo the world, Armand is one of the great figures of Mormon Studies and its preeminent social scientist.\\u00a0 To me, Armand was a mentor and, more importantly, a dear friend.\\u00a0 He happily let me join his class on the social science of Mormonism back in the early days of the CGU Mormon Studies program, and I learned just as much during our conversations while we carpooled each week from Irvine to Claremont as I did in the class.\\u00a0 My own foray into Mormon Studies grew out of discussions we had about the social science of religion and the differences between his field of sociology and my field of economics.\\u00a0 He was kind enough to read drafts of my work and offer his typical incisive but constructive criticism, and he later recruited me to serve with him on the _Dialogue_ Board of Directors.\\n\\nBut nothing is more memorable than the time my wife Caroline and I spent with him and his wife Ruth getting lunch at Mimi\\u2019s Cafe or in our home discussing all things Mormon Studies and culture.\\u00a0 He loved to share stories about the field\\u2019s early days and always bemoaned with a smile the fact that the younger generation so often had to sort out their own understanding of issues confronted by others decades before.\\u00a0 I count myself lucky that his retirement to Irvine coincided with my getting hired at UC Irvine.\\u00a0 I count myself even luckier that I was able to spend so much time in his company.\\u00a0 I am saddened by the news of his death but glad to celebrate his life and memory.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Claudia Bushman**  \\n**Professor Emerita of American Studies, Columbia University**\\n\\nFarewell, Armand, my beloved fellow California Mormon.\\u00a0 How I will miss you, your keen insights, your straight talk, your unceasing Labors toward good ends.\\u00a0 All best to you and Ruth.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Richard Bushman**  \\n**Professor Emeritus, Columbia University**  \\n**Inaugural Holder of the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies**\\n\\nI have said that Armand Mauss was the premier theorist of Mormonism in our generation.\\u00a0 His conception of the internal dynamics of the Church\\u2019s social development was really unmatched.\\u00a0 He was a great mind and a great soul.\\u00a0 Who was more generous with his time and attention than Armand?\\u00a0 I loved him.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Joseph Bentley**  \\n**Chair of the CGU Mormon Studies Council, 2005-2010**\\n\\nI have always regarded Armand as an indispensable cog in that program.\\u00a0 While I was pleased to invite Richard Bushman to apply for the Howard W. Hunter professorship, then oversaw much of the program\\u2019s development during its formative years, it was Armand who really put the rubber on the road.\\n\\nI think he was the first ever to teach any courses in Mormon Studies at CGU.\\u00a0 He started as an adjunct professor soon after I brought him onto the MS Council in 2004 and he taught for the next four years until the Bushmans arrived in 2008.\\u00a0 His credibility with other faculty members enabled his appointment as a most effective member of the search committee, where he guided the selection of Richard Bushman as a senior professor. He was instrumental in creating the highly active Claremont Mormon Studies Student Association, then continued as our liaison with it and with the School of Religion for about a decade.\\n\\nIn the latter capacity, he helped to administer the combined operating budget under the 2006 endowment agreement between CGU and the Hunter Foundation.\\u00a0 That was especially crucial during CGU\\u2019s financial meltdown during the national financial crisis, beginning in late 2008 while I was out of the country.\\u00a0 Even with his limited retirement resources, he annually donated all that he could afford to the CGU Hunter endowment, setting a superb example.\\n\\nIn his own humble but scholarly way, Armand was faithful and true and loyal to God, to gospel principles and to sound academics. In short, he was our \\u201cman for all seasons,\\u201d and \\u201cfor all reasons,\\u201d at CGU.\\u00a0 I loved the man and always will.\\u00a0 I shall miss him, as will all who served with him until he retired from that service to care for his beloved wife Ruth.\\u00a0 My desire is to be reunited with both of them in a higher realm some day!\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Rick Richmond**  \\n**Chairman of the Howard W. Hunter Foundation**\\n\\nArmand was a towering figure in Mormon Studies. He was not only a pioneer in the field, but a humble, dedicated, and persistent pursuer of truth and supporter of the Mormon Studies program at the Claremont Graduate University. I was privileged to serve with Armand on the Mormon Studies Council and will be forever grateful for that opportunity. He will be missed but never forgotten.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**John Dalton**  \\n**First Chairman of the Howard W. Hunter Foundation**\\n\\nArmand was a gentle giant in so many different arenas. He was constantly incisive and keenly thoughtful as the Mormon Studies program was proposed, researched, and finally came to successful fruition at Claremont. He was a constant source of common sense and reasoning. He is surely along with his eternal sweetheart never to be forgotten.

That year, missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) began proselytizing among the white European South Africans.[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1) Church growth was minimal during the early years, as a language barrier and government restrictions halted missionary work in South Africa from 1865-1903. Starting in 1930 LDS missionaries began working in Zimbabwe and during the twentieth century missionary efforts began to increase in African nations from the late 1970\\u2019s, coinciding with the lifting of the 1978 temple and priesthood ban against those of African descent.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2) As the LDS church grew on the continent, an African Area was established in 1990. Today, Africa is one of the fastest growing areas for the LDS church.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3) The LDS church has over 2,300 congregations, thirty-five missions, and four temples in thirty-one of the fifty-four African countries that are recognized by the African Union and the United Nations. Currently, LDS membership in Africa has surpassed 660,000.[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4)\\n\\nThe Community of Christ (CoC) also has a presence in Africa with membership steadily increasing, despite the Western decline in its membership.[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5) Currently, the CoC has congregations in twelve of the African nations with a collective membership of around 35,000. Unlike the LDS church, the CoC has ordained an indigenous African man, Bunda C. Chibwe, and an indigenous African woman, Catherine Mambwe, to the highest ecclesiastical body, the Quorum of the Twelve.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6) The CoC missionary model is slightly different than that of the LDS model in that they set up nonprofit foundations and work through partnership and service within specific countries in order to build their membership.[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Methods and Themes\\n\\nMormon Studies scholars working in the African context use a mixed methodological approach, as many religionists do, including historical analysis, oral history and ethnographic work. Unfortunately, the majority of researchers have been American or European, and there are only a few indigenous scholars in Africa who are working in this growing field.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nScholars working in Africa seem to focus on three main themes in their work. First, the priesthood/temple ban is mentioned in almost all work, due to the fact that anyone with African ancestors were banned from participating in temple ordinances, and Africans were not able to obtain the priesthood.[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9) This restriction was in effect from the time of Brigham Young until 1978 and its centrality in the literature is understandable as it affected so many people, including those who lived in Africa.[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10) Russell Stevenson\\u2019s examination of Rebecca Mould and her story of conversion and leadership in Ghana is a good historical examination of the way in which both the temple ban and the American culture bumped up against early Ghanaian conversions and retention within the LDS church.[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11) Scholarship on the CoC has been able to avoid this myopic focus since all adult males have been able to hold the priesthood since 1865 and women were allowed to hold the priesthood in the latter part of the twentieth century. A few CoC scholars have pointed out that racism has not been entirely avoided but generally they have been able to move in new directions.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)\\n\\nThe second predominant theme is that of the imperialistic tendencies of the American church. Scholars working in Mormonism in Africa have noted that Christianity is experiencing massive growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, and although both the LDS and CoC organizations have seen impressive growth in Africa, when compared to the growth of other African Christianities, they lag behind.[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13) One explanation for the lack of LDS growth, when compared to other Christian traditions, may be that the American-headquartered church resists local customs being integrated into church worship and practices.[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14) The LDS church requires strict adaptation of African members in dress, language and worship services, encouraging a duplicatable experience for members. In other words, the hope is that one can walk into any LDS church in the world and have the familiar hymns, formula and lessons. The CoC have allowed more cultural adaptations in their African congregations, however, both churches have been critiqued for keeping the centrality of America firmly intact.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15)\\n\\nPhilip Jenkins points out that despite the obvious connections between LDS and African beliefs regarding the importance of the extended family and communal connections, the LDS growth rate will remain hindered without allowing for cultural assimilation of local worship styles.[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) Jehu J. Hanciles observes that globalization is changing the face of Christianity, and Mormonism is transitioning to a religion of brown and black members.[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17) Despite this transition, Hanciles notes that \\u201cthe inescapable conclusion is that Mormon voices within North America control the flow of ideas and almost exclusively shape the LDS Church\\u2019s narrative.\\u201d[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18) Finally, Walter van\\u00a0Beek joins these and other scholars in calling for cultural adaptation of local customs in order to grow the LDS membership in Africa. Van Beek\\u2019s analysis of \\u201cgospel culture\\u201d wrapped up in \\u201cDeseret culture\\u201d reveals the pervasive nature and serious pitfalls of American religious imperialism within Mormonism. Perhaps van Beek\\u2019s most astute analysis is that in a religion that preaches and values agency, allowing local customs to inform non-doctrinal practices is a way of honoring agency.[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)\\n\\nThe last major theme is that of missionary and institutional history of LDS members in Africa and their stories of faith. The LDS church has published many articles about missionary work in Africa in the devotional journals such as the _Ensign_ and _BYU Quarterly_, examining experiences of members and missionaries in Kenya, the Ivory Coast, South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana.[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20) Scholars have also published about these same topics in academic journals.[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21) The CoC is also in the midst of chronicling their foray into various African nations through their institutional publications, \\u00a0_Saints Herald/ Herald_.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\nArchival sources held by both the LDS and the CoC organizations are rich resources for scholars of Mormon Studies. The LDS Church History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah has a large collection of oral histories that have been carefully documented by D. Dmitri Hurlbut in a bibliography that is alphabetized by African country and includes \\u201cthe oral histories of converts, missionaries, and Latter\\u2013day Saints whose careers took them to Africa for other reasons, such as foreign service officers at the U.S. Department of State.\\u201d[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22) In addition to the oral histories at the LDS Church History Library, there are over 800 oral histories archived at the L. Tom Perry Special Collections held at Brigham Young University Library.[\\\\[23\\\\]](#_ftn23) Special Collections at the Libraries of the Claremont Colleges also houses collections containing oral histories from South African LDS women, as well as oral histories from Latter-day Saint men and women from Madagascar.[\\\\[24\\\\]](#_ftn24) Soon oral histories of LDS women in Botswana and LDS women and men in Nigeria will be added to their online collections. These oral histories were conducted between 2015-2020 by researchers working on academic papers and/or Claremont Global Mormon Studies research grants.\\n\\nThe CoC Library Archive has twentieth century reports on Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, and Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo in their publications _Saints Herald/Herald_ magazines with copies stored in the Joseph Smith Historical Society in Nauvoo.[\\\\[25\\\\]](#_ftn25) These are ripe for academic analysis and comparison between the LDS and CoC expansion projects into Africa.\\n\\nIndividual scholars continue to collect oral histories, including those working with Claremont Mormon Studies, the LDS church, and independent scholars working to document history on the ground through lived religious experiences. As research into Mormonism in Africa is still in its infancy, these will inevitably help give scholars and interested parties information on the most pertinent research questions and pressing needs within the field.\\n\\nGeographically, most work has been done examining the countries of Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya and Rwanda.[\\\\[26\\\\]](#_ftn26) There is ample opportunity to extend research beyond these specific African countries, and beyond the LDS-heavy emphasis within Mormon studies.[\\\\[27\\\\]](#_ftn27)\\n\\nSome of the most pressing issues for those studying Mormonism in Africa will be an examination of how American racism and sexism has stalled conversions, as well as reasons that growth lags behind when compared to the explosion of Christianity. Examining issues of violence, peace and conflict, systemic poverty and postcolonial interactions may also bare fruitful explanations for what converts within Mormonism need from their church leaders. Regardless of the direction scholars take the newer sub-field of Mormonism in Africa, it will certainly fuel academic conversations for years to come.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAmy Hoyt is a scholar of religion and studies Mormonism in North America and Africa.

One gift helps fund the Roland Reiss Endowed Chair in Art, a senior level faculty position named after a former CGU Art Department chair, while the other gift provides for the fellowship.\\n\\nThe fellowship recipient for 2012-2013 was Leslie Love Stone, a conceptual painter who graduated in May.\\n\\n![Image 1: donor-beverly-benjamin-art.jpg](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-beverly-benjamin-art.jpg)\\n\\n\\\"Kind of Blue\\\" solo exhibition by Leslie Love Stone. Photo courtesy of Leslie Love Stone.\\n\\n\\\"Since coming to Claremont, I've had the great pleasure to meet the Benjamin family\\u2014they are warm, generous, and passionate about education. For me, their fellowship has been a most appreciated invitation to join the community of professional artists and a challenge to stay the course,\\\" Stone said.\\n\\nHelping art students \\\"stay the course\\\" has been the purpose behind the fellowship all along, as Beverly Benjamin explained. After all, Karl himself knew first-hand how challenging it is to establish yourself early on as an artist.\\n\\nA Good Teacher  \\nKarl Benjamin began his college education in 1943 at Northwestern University in Chicago. He later opted to enlist in the U.S. Navy, and after his military service he moved to Southern California. He resumed his studies at what is now known as the University of Redlands. There, he met Beverly. Both eventually received bachelor's degrees and were married.\\n\\nWhile at Redlands, Beverly said, three different career paths were presented to Karl: Heavy equipment operator, salesperson for the Pep Boys auto parts chain, or teacher.\\n\\nInspired by his mother, who taught high school science, Karl opted to enter the classroom.\\n\\n\\\"He had a soft spot in his heart for the fact that his mother had always been such a good teacher and was so prized by her students that at the age of 85 she was still corresponding with them,\\\" Beverly said.\\n\\nKarl began teaching at grade schools in San Bernardino County, eventually moving his growing family to Claremont in 1952. It was around this time when his interest in art emerged. Asked to incorporate art lessons into his students' curriculum, Karl brought them simple, affordable material\\u2014crayons and paper, for example\\u2014and gave them assignments like, \\\"make a rainbow,\\\" according to 2008 interview for an online art journal.\\n\\n\\\"During his years of teaching public school, he was known for bringing out really beautiful things,\\\" Beverly recalled. \\\"He bought the kids oil pastels. Maybe that's where he got the idea about providing a graduate student with enough of a fellowship to buy some materials.\\\"\\n\\nKarl\\u2014who had no formal background or training in art at the time\\u2014eventually decided to pick up a brush himself.\\n\\n\\\"Reverse Jackson Pollock\\\"  \\n\\\"He came to painting rather later,\\\" Beverly said. \\\"He was already teaching sixth grade . . . so he knew how hard it was to be able to afford paint and canvas and the beginnings of a studio.\\\"\\n\\nHis initial attempt, inspired by surrealist Joan Mir\\u00f3, was a critical first step into the world of art. \\\"Boy, that first painting\\u2014big addiction. It just hit in his heart,\\\" Beverly said. By the late 1950s, Karl had focused on geometry and color, and was considered part of a noteworthy small circle of Southern California-based abstract classicists. In 1959, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art organized a show of Karl and others' work that received wide acclaim.\\n\\nAccording to a 2012 New York Times tribute, Karl's \\\"canvases were known for their simple, repeating geometric shapes, gridlike orderliness and fields of exuberant color that almost never bled into one another. It was a style that made him a sort of reverse Jackson Pollock, who epitomized the New York-based Abstract Expressionist school with his epic canvases of seemingly chaotic splashings and drippings.\\\"\\n\\nInterest in his style spiked again during the 1990s when a whole generation of artists\\u2014including CGU art professor David Pagel\\u2014rediscovered it.\\n\\nContinued Giving  \\nKarl also served as an art professor at CGU and Pomona College and at the time of his death he was lauded as \\\"a dedicated mentor to generations of CGU art students.\\\" Even after Benjamin retired, he kept i  \\nn touch with the university, visited students' studios, and attended their exhibitions  \\n\\\"He just loved being part of a graduate school,\\\" Beverly said, and his retirement in the mid-1990s didn't impact his commitment.\\n\\n\\\"When he retired, he had had so many students\\u2014a full class roster full of graduate students,\\\" Beverly said. \\\"The students would come to him and say, \\u2018Could you please find the time to finish out my second year.' Or, \\u2018I'm just coming into this and I need your help.' This would continue for at least 10 years.\\n\\n\\\"And that was his retirement activity,\\\" Beverly said.\\n\\n\\\"These people become good friends, lifelong friends. People who were students of Karl back in 1979, 1980 were still his good friends . . . until the day he died.\\\"\\n\\nIt is through the Benjamin fellowship that Karl's legacy of continued giving lives on.\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad to have my name on this fellowship,\\\" Beverly said. \\\"It's nice to have given something to the school.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2: donor-beverly-benjamin.jpg](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-beverly-benjamin.jpg)\\n\\nPhoto by Carlos Puma\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

To observe differences in neural activity of alcohol-relevant associative effects, the proposed project will involve a between subjects comparison of hazardous alcohol users and light alcohol users on validated tests of implicit memory and cognition (a cue-behavior-outcome association task and alcohol-related-Implicit Association Test). By eliciting activation of associative alcohol-relevant memories through performance on these indirect tests of association, it is possible to increase our understanding of individual differences in associative structures that influence alcohol and other substance use behavior.\\n\\nInvestigators\\n-------------\\n\\n![Image 1: Susan Ames](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2016/11/ames3.jpg)  \\n[**Susan L.

She believes in illustrating her culture as a way of protecting their stories.\\n\\nThe artist can easily imagine her own interpretation without being hindered by the historical stereotypes society has placed on a people.

She was immediately drawn to the tight-knit Latter-day Saint community with its many activities, as well as to the fact that the church had answers for a lot of life\\u2019s big questions. After graduating from high school she came to Utah and quickly met her husband, an engineering student and returned missionary who served in Belgium. Martine\\u2019s first child was born with a rare genetic condition and died at four months. Her second child was healthy, but her third also died of the same genetic condition. These experiences were incredibly painful, but her ward in Louisiana rallied around them as she cared for her last child, who died at thirteen months.\\n\\nThe deaths of her children, particularly her last child, shook her faith in the plan of salvation, as did some experiences with local church leaders (her stake president in Louisiana was excommunicated for embezzlement). As someone who questioned authority, the church became a less comfortable place for her. After over thirty years of church activity, she decided to step away from the church. Her husband, who served as bishop at one point, still attends sometimes. Martine has had a number of jobs over the years, but her most recent one was as the Executive Director of the Utah Association of Health Underwriters. She also ran for the Utah House as a Republican in 2004.\\n\\nMartine has long-term connections with Latter-day Saints in Belgium, and she reports that many Latter-day Saint units in Belgium are shrinking or being eliminated. These disappearing branches and wards are putting strains on Belgian Latter-day Saints, as they have to travel long distances to get to church and don\\u2019t have the kind of strong local community she experienced when she was a teen in Belgium. Reflecting on her life, Martine does not regret joining the church. It enabled her to come to the US, to meet her husband, and to graduate from college. As someone from a lower middle-class background, she would not have had the chance to attend college in Belgium, and she\\u2019s grateful for the opportunities she\\u2019s had here in the US.\\n\\nRead or listen to [Martine Dirick Smith\\u2019s full oral history](https://ccdl.claremont.edu/digital/collection/cms/id/317/rec/32).\\n\\n![Image 2: Martine Dirick Smith](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/Martine-Dirick-Smith.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 3: a group of people posing for a picture in front of a green lawn](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/wedding.jpg)\\n\\nWedding of Martine\\u2019s son in 2005.\\n\\n[![Image 4: Martine as teen on bus](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/Martine-Teen-on-Bus-300x209.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/06/Martine-Teen-on-Bus.jpg)\\n\\nA branch outing in Belgium with members and missionaries on a rented bus.

Another gift from the tribe, along with gifts from Prime Healthcare and other supporters, helped fund renovations to the interior of the architecturally significant building, whose name, Yuhaaviatam, is a Serrano word meaning People of the Pines.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies is a wonderful example of partnership,\\u201d CGU President Len Jessup said about the transformational gifts. \\u201cI could not be more grateful to the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians and our other supporters for their belief in CGU\\u2019s commitment to make a difference in the world. The center will benefit our faculty and students, but most important, it will expand their ability to improve lives, especially in communities that need it most.\\u201d\\n\\nCGU collaborates with more than 300 health-related organizations to improve the quality of life, especially in communities most in need. Our goal is to provide powerful, impactful solutions to seemingly intractable challenges.\\n\\nOur Center\\n----------\\n\\nScholars across CGU\\u2019s seven schools and divisions are conducting innovative research on proactive and behavioral approaches to health in a variety of areas, including prevention strategies, chronic disease management, and health-driven technologies that provide accessibility to support networks and programs.\\n\\nCGU's New Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies Featured on ABC7 Los Angeles\\n\\nAll of these efforts come together in a 23,000 square-foot facility at the southeast corner of the university campus that served for 50 years as The Claremont Colleges\\u2019 central bookstore. Once renovations are completed, the center will house CGU\\u2019s School of Community & Global Health as its anchor tenant.\\n\\nOur Advantage\\n-------------\\n\\nComplex issues demand approaches that transcend discrete fields. At CGU, we call this transdisciplinarity, and it is at the heart of our educational model. Transdisciplinarity has been embedded in our DNA since our founding in 1925. It involves taking on complex problems important to society and including diverse stakeholders to find a resolution. This is what we are doing at the Yuhaaviatam Center.\\n\\nHere are just a few examples of how our experts have already made a difference:\\n\\n### Health-Driven Technology\\n\\nThe emerging interdisciplinary research field of Persuasive Technology, focused on how interactive technologies and services can support positive behavior change, holds great promise for improving and extending lives. Professor Samir Chatterjee\\u2019s MyHeart app, for example, helps patients by collecting diagnostic data and other feedback on a daily basis that is monitored remotely by hospital caregivers, who can determine whether intervention is needed.\\n\\n### Proactive Health Management\\n\\nResearch across CGU is addressing root causes of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity, as well as disease management and follow-up care. \\u201cDiseases of despair\\u201d\\u2014drug addiction, depression, and suicide, among others\\u2014are reducing life expectancy, especially in underserved communities. Faculty are studying a range of holistic approaches and interventions that pay particular attention to the needs of these communities.\\n\\n### Healthcare Policy\\n\\nUnderstanding the government labyrinth\\u2014 what makes a policy effective or ineffective\\u2014 can improve social and economic outcomes. Professors in the School of Social Science, Policy & Evaluation are studying the relationship between social justice and well-being, and research in the Division of Politics and Economics is focusing on the efficacy of federal health programs such as the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid managed care.\\n\\n### Mindfulness\\n\\nCGU is a leader in the field of Positive Health Psychology, which explores how to maintain physical and mental well-being despite the presence of otherwise harmful physical, social, or environmental conditions. The Adolescent Moral Development Lab is addressing questions around purpose and gratitude, with a focus on youth growing up in poorly resourced communities.\\n\\nA New Vision for Healthcare at Claremont Graduate University\\n\\n![Image 1: Huntley Bookstore exterior](https://info.cgu.edu/ychs/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2020/02/huntley-slider-new.jpg)\\n\\n#### About the Huntley Building\\n\\nEstablished through a gift of the Earl W. Huntley Foundation, the Huntley Bookstore was designed by architects A. Quincy Jones and Frederick Emmons in the mid-century modern post-and-beam style. The building extensively uses concrete block and exposed wood, and its floor-to-ceiling glass windows are intended to integrate the interior and the outdoors. The building was dedicated on November 6, 1969, the same year that Jones and Emmons were awarded the AIA\\u2019s prestigious Architecture Firm Award. The building, at the heart of the Claremont Colleges, is the ideal location for the center. The historically important exterior has been gently restored, and the remodeled interior provides opportunities for discovery and collaboration.\\n\\n#### About Claremont Graduate University\\n\\nFounded in 1925, Claremont Graduate University is one of a select few American universities devoted entirely to graduate-level education. The university is a founding member of The Claremont Colleges, which include Pomona College, Pitzer College, Claremont McKenna College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd College, and Keck Graduate Institute. CGU comprises seven schools offering 76 degree and certificate programs. The university\\u2019s unique transdisciplinary approach to education \\u00a0encourages students to explore complex issues across academic disciplines. Along with master\\u2019s and PhD programs, CGU offers several [professional doctorate programs](https://www.cgu.edu/professional-doctorate/) for those who want to rise in the ranks outside academia and research.\\n\\nFor more information, visit\\u00a0[cgu.edu](https://www.cgu.edu/).\\n\\n#### About the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians\\n\\nThe San Manuel Band of Serrano Mission Indians is a federally recognized American Indian tribe located near the city of Highland, California. The Serrano clan is indigenous to the San Bernardino Valley, known today as the Inland Empire. The San Manuel Reservation was established in 1891 and recognized as a sovereign nation with the right of self-government. As an indigenous community, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians\\u2019 origins and history stem from their relationship with the land and to all who share it. Its ancestors have handed down the tradition of expressing themselves through a culture of giving. As one of the largest employers in the Inland Empire, San Manuel is able to answer the call of Yawa\\u2019 (a Serrano word meaning \\u201cto act on one\\u2019s beliefs\\u201d) through partnerships with charitable organizations that make a difference in the lives of thousands of families across the country. It draws upon its history, knowledge, expertise, and cultural values to direct its philanthropic giving in the region, as well as to Native American causes nationwide.\\n\\nFor more information, visit [sanmanuel-nsn.gov](https://www.sanmanuel-nsn.gov/).\\n\\n#### Giving Opportunities\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies and potential giving opportunities, please contact Kristen Andersen-Daley, Vice President, Development & External Relations.\\n\\n[kristen.andersen-daley@cgu.edu](mailto:kristen.andersen-daley@cgu.edu)  \\n909-607-8252\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Yuhaaviatam Center for Health Studies\", \"source\": \"https://info.cgu.edu/ychs\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Loading Events](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/resources/images/tribe-loading.gif)\\n\\nRestorative Yoga + Sound Bath Sessions\\n\\nThe EmPOWER presents a Spring \\u201824 Restorative Yoga + Sound Bath series.

Drew holds the Joseph B. Platt Chair in the Management of Technology. His principal appointment is in the School of Educational Studies, where his teaching focuses on data analytics, statistical analysis, and model building. For 10 years Drew served as dean of the School of Educational Studies.\\n\\nPrior to joining the CGU faculty, he was a senior information scientist at the RAND corporation. Prior to that, he held senior research positions at the National Research Council and the American Council on Education. Earlier he held a research faculty position at Harvard University, from which he received his PhD, and served as head applications programmer at the Harvard Computing Center.\\n\\nHe is the author of more than 200 publications, including nine\\u00a0books, about a) the improvement of mathematics and science instruction at all levels of education, b) the development and evaluation of effective undergraduate programs, c) building strong university research programs, and d) health education. These publications include a book reporting an evaluation he directed of a billion-dollar National Science Foundation program, a RAND report for the White House about federal funding of biomedical research, and a book about how to increase research productivity in the nation\\u2019s universities.\\n\\nWhen the National University of Singapore celebrated its 100-year anniversary and hosted an international conference about education and globalization, Drew was invited to give the keynote speech. In the past few years, he has been a consultant or advisor to the senior leadership of the College Board, the Los Angeles Police Department, Patagonia (an international clothing company), and the Nevada Higher Education System.\\n\\nDrew\\u2019s research interests focus on social justice and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). He has identified discriminatory barriers that prevent many marginalized students from accessing STEM courses and has worked with school districts, colleges, and universities on programs that remove those barriers and facilitate both student access and student success. His book _STEM the Tide: Reforming Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education in America_ is published by Johns Hopkins University Press.\\n\\nHe presently is writing two books. The first, tentatively titled _Creating Technology As Though Human Beings Mattered_, draws upon his background in computer science and in sociology. He discusses both the positive and the negative transformational changes in society brought by digital technology and argues that we are reaching a tipping point after which the negative effects, for example the impact on social inequality, will outweigh the positive effects. The second, tentatively titled _Our Days Are Numbered_, is a novel set in academia about the forces reshaping higher education and about the nature and meaning of time.\\n\\n\\u201cSTEM Education: Global Trends.\\u201d In R.

However, her self-doubt went beyond simply being a woman in a man\\u2019s world. Increasingly often she found herself thinking, \\u201cI am an incredible failure\\u201d (1).\\n\\nMany female leaders experience a sense of not deserving or belonging in their position. This sensation is commonly referred to as the Impostor Phenomenon (IP). We ask ourselves if these doubts are unwarranted and wonder if they accurately reflect our true capabilities. Yet impostor feelings can be so overwhelming that they\\u2019re difficult to dismiss. As a result, we continue to question if we are really cut out for the job. So what can a woman experiencing the IP do?\\n\\nFirst of all, let\\u2019s go back to Maria. Her story is the real life narrative of Maria Klawe, Ph.D. Dr. Klawe is currently the President of Harvey Mudd College and was formerly the Dean of Engineering at Princeton University and the Dean of Science at the University of British Columbia. By most objective standards, Dr. Klawe has achieved remarkable success. Yet, she grapples with feelings of failure and doubts that she deserves this success (1). The takeaway here is that no one is immune to impostor feelings.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what we know about the IP. Defined as an internal experience of intellectual phoniness, the IP is experienced more frequently and to a greater extent by women than by men (2, 3). The epitome of the IP is a smart woman who believes she is not actually smart and that she has simply fooled anyone who thinks she is. She is terrified of being evaluated and \\u201cfound out\\u201d (2, 3) because she fears the humiliation of failure. She doubts that she is able to live up to others\\u2019 expectations of her (3). She is unable to realistically assess her own competence and chronically underestimates herself while overestimating others (3). This woman may accomplish achievements that are successful by objective standards, yet fails to internalize these accomplishments, even when she receives positive feedback or praise from others (3).\\n\\nThat failure to internalize success is a defining feature of the IP. People experiencing the IP tend to attribute their success to factors such as luck, being at the right place at the right time, extra effort, or the misjudgment of others. This is related to the idea that unexpected levels of performance are attributed to either a temporary cause (e.g., extra effort) or an external cause (e.g. luck). On the other hand, expected levels of performance are attributed to stable causes (e.g., intelligence) (2). Society\\u2019s expectations of women tend to be incompatible with expectations of leaders (4). So when a woman achieves success as a leader, that woman may perceive her success as an unexpected level of performance. Therefore, she is less likely to attribute her success to its real cause (her own intelligence) and is left feeling like a phony.\\n\\n**What Causes the Impostor Phenomenon?**\\n\\nTrigger events are often responsible for stirring up impostor feelings (5). Triggers represent changes in a person\\u2019s circumstances that may be dramatic or subtle, positive or negative, and arise from internal or external sources (5). Examples include promotions, changing employers, or starting a new career. Trigger events act as catalysts for heightened self-awareness (5) and prompt comparisons of ourselves to relevant others.\\n\\nAlthough trigger events may increase the likelihood that you will experience impostor feelings, you still have a choice about you will react to those feelings. And there are some really compelling reasons to not let the IP stand in your way.\\n\\n**3 Reasons Why You Shouldn\\u2019t Let the Impostor Phenomenon Stop You.**\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the IP holds women back! Because women are more prone to experiencing the IP, it can prove exceedingly detrimental to current and aspiring female leaders. Remember, the IP is based on distorted perceptions. Impostor feelings may cause a woman to decline a professional opportunity for which she is actually qualified. This further perpetuates the lack of women both currently in leadership positions and in the pipeline. In other words, IP sufferers may not be achieving at their maximum potential (3).\\n\\nFurthermore, the IP may lead to inauthenticity, or not divulging one\\u2019s true feelings or opinions (2). A person who feels phony is likely not behaving in a way that is fully authentic. They may put on a facade in an attempt to \\u201clook the part\\u201d and have not internalized their own strengths (3). Such inauthenticity is not only an exhausting ruse to maintain, but it may also interfere with relationships with others, leading to a lack of trust (6).\\n\\nLastly, the IP has been associated with multiple, negative outcomes. Combating feelings of phoniness can lead to anxiety, depression, and lack of confidence (2). The results of impostor feelings are not only undesirable, they are also unhealthy.\\n\\nIn summary, if you have self-doubts that are not based on an objective assessment of your competence, then it\\u2019s possible you are experiencing the IP. The IP has many negative implications. Sufferers may not be achieving at their maximum potential (3) and it is neither healthy nor enjoyable to experience. Impostor feelings are based on distorted thought processes and may contribute to suboptimal decision-making. Trigger events may provoke the IP and are occasions to be particularly vigilant in guarding against the effects of impostor feelings.\\n\\n**About the Author**\\n\\nLeslie Trainor, M.B.A., is a Ph.D. student in Organizational Psychology.

AI methods have evolved from three different domains including (see for example, McKinsey\\u2019s \\u201cAn executive\\u2019s guide to AI,\\u201d [link](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/an-executives-guide-to-ai)): Statistics (e.g., K-means clustering as a popular statistics-based unsupervised machine learning algorithm), operations research or OR (e.g., support vector machines or SVMs) and bio-computational science.\\n\\n**Mimicking nature: From neural networks or deep learning \\u2026 to simulation**  \\nBio-computational methods loosely mimic biological phenomena. Neural networks are an example of such AI. They are now called \\u201cdeep learning\\u201d and were originally derived from our understanding of how the human brain works (MIT, [link](http://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414)). One powerful application of computational AI in general is in simulation. In his now famous and highly influential classic of modern AI, \\u201cThe Science of the Artificial\\u201d ([link](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sciences-artificial)), Herb Simon, a 1978 Nobel laureate ([link](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1978/press-release/)) and 1975 Turing Award winner ([link](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/simon_1031467.cfm)), lays out a foundation for systematically harnessing the power of information processing to design and engineer better performing systems.\\n\\n**Decomposition, hierarchy, and adaption**  \\nSimon points to a few \\u201ctricks\\u201d for decomposing the complexity of systems to improve our understanding of them. They include thinking in hierarchies, building blocks, and adaptive interactions. A system can be decomposed into a hierarchy of \\u201cchunks\\u201d or \\u201cbuilding blocks\\u201d of simple behaviors that interact and adapt in a complex environment. Simon uses the human body as an example: It is a very complex system with many elements functioning simultaneously, yet it can be decomposed hierarchically \\u201cinto organs, organs into tissues, tissues into cells\\u201d (p. 186).\\n\\n**80/20 efficiency of simulation-based computational explanations**  \\nVery often, it is impossible to test entire systems. It may be too dangerous, expensive, time-consuming \\u2026 even illegal. With simulation it is possible to build an abstraction of the truth that is focused on only those key \\u201cbuilding blocks\\u201d and interactions that are relevant to the investigation. If it is done scientifically and rigorously \\u2013 think of clinical trials for new medication, such as vaccines \\u2013 results will be highly probable. In such, simulation embodies the Parento principle, a business efficiency measure, which states that, for many events, roughly 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.\\n\\nRead about how we put Simon\\u2019s tricks to work to create true business advantage in:\\u00a0_Schlueter Langdon, C. 2020.

Differential equations are of basic importance in engineering mathematics because many physical laws and relations appear mathematically in the form of differential equations. The course will focus on the classical partial differential equations of mathematical physics: the wave equation, the diffusion equation and Laplace\\u2019s equation with some variations. We will develop important techniques of finding general solutions for the classical PDEs in explicit form. When an explicit form of the solution is unavailable we will apply qualitative analysis to study existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solutions of the equations.\\n\\nInstructor for APM384H1:\\n\\nMarina Chugunova, HU 1025, (416) 946-3769, chugunom@math.utoronto.ca  \\n_Lectures:_\\u00a0Monday (10:00 \\u2013 12:00) SF3202, Wednesday (11:00 \\u2013 12:00) BA1180  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0Monday (16:00 \\u2013 18:00) HU 1025  \\n(elevators do not take you on the 10th floor please go upstairs)\\n\\nTeaching assistant:\\n\\nJohn Collett: office: BA6135, 416-978-4794, collett.jd@gmail.com  \\n_Office hours:_\\u00a0supervision of APM384 Forum.  \\n_Tutorials:_\\u00a0TUT 01 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Wed \\u00a0 10:00 \\u2013 11:00 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 GB404  \\nTUT 02 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Tue \\u00a0 \\u00a0 17:00 \\u2013 18:00 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 WB219\\n\\nFormat:\\n\\nThe lectures form the essential content of the course, and you are responsible for all material covered in lectures (unless otherwise indicated.)

We offer the opportunity to develop a personalized curriculum based on the student\\u2019s interests by taking courses not only within the management program but also in departments across the university, such as economics, organizational psychology, information systems, and more.\\n\\nThe program is academically rigorous, yet flexible, as students work closely with faculty on robust research relevant to critical issues affecting management practices worldwide. Students will produce research, publications, and a dissertation in the final three years of the program.\\n\\n##### Program\\u00a0Highlights\\n\\n*   Building on Peter Drucker\\u2019s management principles and his legacy of innovation, the PhD will allow you explore and examine important issues in management\\n*   Determine your own pace \\u2013 take classes while employed and transfer up to 24 units from master\\u2019s level coursework completed at an accredited institution\\n*   Learn research methodologies from multiple departments at CGU to create original, transdisciplinary research that breaks new ground\\n*   Your degree is AACSB accredited\\u2014the highest standard for business education\\n\\nProgram At-a-glance\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   PhD in Management\\n    \\n    degree awarded\\n    \\n\\n*   Spring, Fall\\n    \\n    program start\\n    \\n*   5 years | full time\\\\*\\n    \\n    estimated completion time\\n    \\n\\nFaculty\\n-------\\n\\n*   ![Image 1: Portrait of Bernie Jaworski](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bernie-jaworski2-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Bernie Jaworski\\n    \\n    Peter F.

E-portfolio entries should be submitted through your Sakai DropBox.\\n\\nTo satisfy this requirement, an entry in the student\\u2019s e-portfolio must be created with the template page for this course, and it must address the learning objectives for the course and program.\\n\\nThe instructor will determine whether the entry suitably reflects course- and program-related learning. \\u00a0She/he may ask the student to revise and resubmit the entry. There are many possible suitable entries.\\u00a0 Possible examples include the deliverables for a class project, a paper written as a result of the course, or a series of blog entries.\\u00a0 Any entry is acceptable that demonstrates that the student knows more about the course content than she/he did at the beginning of the course.\\u00a0 It is important that the entry be non-trivial, but it need not be a major new undertaking either.\\u00a0 Entries are intended to be a representation of what was learned.\\n\\nThis is a special assignment.\\u00a0 It is not used in calculation of your course grade; it is a requirement to get a grade.\\u00a0 No final grade other than \\u201cIncomplete\\u201d (except \\u201cUnsatisfactory\\u201d) will be assigned for the course until you have posted a suitable entry to your e-portfolio.\\u00a0 Any e-portfolio entry intended to be used to satisfy the requirement for the course must remain in the student\\u2019s Sakai DropBox for at least one month following the course, to allow time for archival of pages to occur.\\n\\nBecause entries to an e-portfolio provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your learning, we encourage you to create more than the one required entry, to share your entries with your classmates, and to collect entries across your classes\\u2014in effect, creating an online collection of postings about what you have been learning.\\u00a0 Such collections have value in expressing to yourself and others what you have learned in your degree program.\\n\\n**Grading components**\\n\\n<table><tbody><tr><td>Mid-term Exam</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Final Exam</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Labs &amp; Assignments (groups of 2)</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>Research Project (individual)</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Class Participation</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>100%</b></td></tr></tbody></table>\\n\\n**Grading scale**\\n\\n97% \\u2013 100% A+\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 93% \\u2013 96.9% A\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 90% \\u2013 92.9% A-\\n\\n87% \\u2013 89.9% B+\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 83% \\u2013 86.9% B\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 80% \\u2013 82.9% B-\\n\\n77% \\u2013 79.9% C+\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a073% \\u2013 76.9% C\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 70% \\u2013 72.9% C-\\n\\nLess than 70% U\\n\\n**_Schedule: (This is suggested; deviations may be necessary)_**\\n\\nAll course materials (PowerPoint slides, papers, labs and assignments) will be available from your Sakai dropbox account.

Feel free to share your thoughts and opinions about a topic that is being discussed. Any assigned reading should be read prior to class. The instructor will keep notes of who is participating. Also, I allow only one absence from class. If you miss more than one class, your participation grade will be significantly affected.\\n\\n**Research Project:**\\n\\nEach student will conduct his/her own independent research. A detailed report has to be turned in. All students will also briefly present their research work in class. \\u00a0Each student will then conduct further research related to emerging networking topics. The objective of the research is to find new advances, and conduct analysis and present your findings to the entire class.\\n\\n**Labs & Assignments:**\\n\\nStudents will do several hands-on labs throughout the course. Various open-source and some proprietary tools will be used and shared in class. There will be group assignments given to students. These may entail design problems and finding out recent advancements happening in the particular topic. The labs are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in class.\\n\\nAll labs and assignments will be available from the Lab and Assignments folder in Sakai. You have always 1 week to complete them. The instructor may ask for the labs anytime for grading. No late submission will be allowed. Completing all labs and assignments is mandatory.\\n\\n**Policy on Plagiarism:**\\n\\nIf I find that you have plagiarized your work, and then based on the consultation with the Director of CISAT, I will either assign you an F for the assignment or depending upon severity of the issue, assign you an F for the entire course.\\n\\n**Welcome to the Course!**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"IST 304 \\u2014 Samir Chatterjee\", \"source\": \"https://scholar.cgu.edu/samir-chatterjee/teaching/ist-304/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 20C AD?  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** Kenya  \\n**Provenience Location:** GravesinSEAfricanvillages  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Alleged looting\\n\\n**Nation:**\\n\\n**Location:** Anon. sellers (KE); Ernie Wolfe (US); Gene Hackman Art Linson (US); Denver Museum of Nature and Science.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\ntotems (vigango) - Unknown\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2014  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2014  \\n**Means of Resolution:** Sua sponte donation\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** National Museums of Kenya  \\n**Complainant Nation:** Kenya  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** In Transition  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Denver Museum of Nature and Science  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Institution\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Kenyan Totems From Graves \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/totems-from-graves-in-kenya/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Home](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts) \\u00a0\\u203a\\u00a0 Aanya: Single in India\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2022\\n\\n![Image 1: this global later - day life](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2022/09/TGLDL-logo-with-dialogue-podcast-symbol-1400x1400-1-1024x1024.jpg)\\n\\n![Image 2: This Global Latter-day Life](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2022/09/TGLDL-logo-with-dialogue-podcast-symbol-150x150.jpg)\\n\\nThis Global Latter-day Life\\n\\nAanya: Single in India\\n\\n![Image 3: Loading](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/assets/css/images/player/images/icon-loader.svg)\\n\\nThis episode features the oral history of Aanya, a convert from India, who is searching for a spouse who shares her vision of partnership and self-development.

Instead, we trade in this idea for an exploration of allostasis: a process of how we internally adapt to new, long-term, external pressures. This week, our guest Heather Campbell, Professor in the Department of Politics and Government, helps frame our conversation around the push-pull forces determining policy in the US. We also discuss COVID-19 as a stress test for our short-term planning, de-centralized services, and environmental (in-)justice. As the pandemic defines more clearly the pressures to which we have no choice but to adapt, we find ourselves compelled to look inward, imagining a more equitable future.\\n\\n[View Episode Details](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/s01e06-atmospheric-pressure/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### S01E05 Spirits in the Material World\\n\\n![Image 11: Sharing Air](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/04/sharing-air-150x150.jpeg)\\n\\nSharing Air\\n\\nS01E05 Spirits in the Material World\\n\\n![Image 12: Loading](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/assets/css/images/player/images/icon-loader.svg)\\n\\nWhether we look squarely into the future with the optimism of science, or we fix our gaze on the past to find wisdom in human experience, uncertain times inspire us to create, creating elegant and memorable theories, essays, and poems. This week, we cast our eyes backward to Early Modern Europe (1500-1750) in order to (re)connect the history of science and philosophy,\\u00a0 the mind-body divide, and the mystery of the soul to our current realities of living (and not living) through the COVID-19 pandemic. Our guest, CGU\\u2019s Provost and Professor Patricia Easton, helps us link the teachings of Rene Descartes to the works of another, equally famous seventeenth century weaver of words and ideas, John Donne\\u2014and, in so doing, allows us to connect their remarkably similar outlooks to those of another transformative, transdisciplinary, and creative era: the present day.\\n\\n[View Episode Details](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/podcast/s01e05-spirits-in-the-material-world/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### S01E04 Parachutes\\n\\n![Image 13: Sharing Air](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/04/sharing-air-150x150.jpeg)\\n\\nSharing Air\\n\\nS01E04 Parachutes\\n\\n![Image 14: Loading](https://info.cgu.edu/podcasts/wp-content/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/assets/css/images/player/images/icon-loader.svg)\\n\\nAs we navigate through the gray spaces of COVID, science, and human experience, we envision a path to landing on our feet in hopes of returning to (a new) normal.

Growing up, we were taught atheism as a way of life and later I even myself taught anti-religion classes in a university; I was singing a different tune, but now I was listening to Battulga saying he had joined the church and was seeing missionaries. I wondered what they were like. Then my husband and children were studying in the United States, and I told them what I heard about the church from Battulga and they responded with a lot of positive feedback about it. When my two daughters were into their mid-adolescence and returned to Mongolia after studying one year in high school in the United States, my daughters joined the church first and then I followed them.\\n\\nI grew up in the countryside\\u2026 The parents believed in Buddhism but engaging in any religious practices was prohibited at that time, hence they could only secretly worship a graven image of Buddha at home, and I grew up watching that. I had a happy childhood. Although my parents were herders, they raised us with a lot of love and taught us to be honest people. I feel nostalgic for this all\\n\\nI studied at a university for five years to become a Russian teacher, then transferred to Russia to improve the qualifications. Upon my return, I taught in schools in Mongolia. In the early years of my teaching career, I was not able to figure out how to deliver my classes, but eventually I learned and mastered the required skills. I even wrote a handbook for new instructors and apprenticed young teachers. I used to tell my students to be good parents first in order to live a good life. The constitution limits teaching students about religion. Therefore, I would share about my faith and gospels to parents of my students during parents\\u2019 night. I told them that I go to church and the students who became church members often brought their blessings to their parents. Many of my students heard about the church from their parents first and then eventually converted in the church, some with their parents even\\u2026 Self-reliance program of the church is one of my most favorite resources. I learned many useful skills thanks to the program, such as how to do things in cost-effective ways.\\n\\n![Image 2: Oyunchimeg Tsendochir with family](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/06/Oyunchimeg-8.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Oyunchimeg Tsendochir - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/tsendochir/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: a vase with a black and yellow design](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/04/default.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/04/default.jpg)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 500 B.C.E.

The department\\u2018s objectives are to impart to students the ability to write clearly and effectively; an understanding of research in their field; a sense of the fields and subfields that shape primary and related disciplines; and the ability to undertake independent research and make an original contribution to their field.\\n\\nThe academic program emphasizes the breadth of American and British literatures, as well as critical theory, the development of research skills, and area expertise at the master\\u2019s and doctoral levels. Along with the interdisciplinary concentrations offered in the School of Arts & Humanities\\u2014American Studies, Early Modern Studies, Hemispheric & Transnational Studies, Media Studies, and Museum Studies\\u2014students may tailor distinct courses of study in cultural studies, gender studies, religion\\u00a0and literature, hemispheric Americas studies, U.S. Latino/a culture and literature, the graphic novel, and more.\\n\\nAs a result of its close ties to other Arts and Humanities departments, the English Department encourages transdisciplinary inquiry in graduate study. All degree tracks allow students to integrate topics in other humanistic disciplines with research in literature and the critical, cultural, and historical context of literary texts. Our program is particularly strong in interdisciplinary\\u00a0and transnational approaches to literature and culture.\\n\\nCGU\\u2019s close-knit community nurtures an atmosphere of lively intellectual engagement while retaining the resources of a large, well-appointed university through membership in the Claremont University Consortium\\u2014with world-class professors and libraries and an active calendar of humanities-focused speakers and events.\\n\\nChair: Eric Bulson  \\n831 N.

IPRC supports the scientific analysis of political, health, socioeconomic, and group-specific inequality in the United States and abroad. We develop evidence-based policy and program solutions to problems related to inequality.\\n\\nInequality is arguably the most transdisciplinary, socially-oriented, and eye-opening problem in the United States and worldwide. Because it deals with a great variety of data sources, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies, inequality represents a vertex where research agendas unify and generate collaborative academic and institutional networks. Yet, even though topics within the realm of inequality can enhance every aspect of the educational process, CGU did not have a research-driven institution dedicated to the study of inequality. We have, therefore, established the Claremont\\u2019s Inequality and Policy Research Center (IPRC) \\u2014a useful platform to encourage the exchange of ideas, attract students, generate resources, and enrich CGU\\u2019s overall academic environment.\\n\\nThe Inequality and Policy Research Center at Claremont Graduate University\\n\\n##### Mission\\n\\nThe IPRC has five main objectives:\\n\\n1.  To support the scientific analysis of political, health, socioeconomic, and group-specific (e.g., gender, racial, ethnic) inequality in the US and abroad.\\n2.  To develop evidence-based policy and program solutions to problems that originate from, or are related to, inequality.\\n3.  To disseminate the research, data, and policy recommendations resulting from IPRC\\u2019s activities.\\n4.  To train and support undergraduate and graduate students on their research and generate cross-disciplinary collaborations between faculty members and institutions.\\n5.

Provost Patricia Easton informed the CGU community of his passing in an email message that called him \\u201ca pillar of CGU Mathematics\\u201d since his arrival in Claremont in 1981.\\n\\nEaston\\u2019s message to the CGU community also acknowledged Cumberbatch\\u2019s humor, saying that \\u201cEllis\\u2019s dry wit will remain with us always.\\u201d Her message closed with the words of poet Mary Elizabeth Frye: \\u201cDo not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there; I do not sleep.\\u201d\\n\\nCumberbatch earned his PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester in 1958. His dissertation foretold the design of an ocean-going ship hull that would allow it to travel in excess of 230 miles per hour. His mathematical contributions and research interests ranged from differential equations and fluid mechanics to semiconductors and industrial modeling.\\n\\nCumberbatch arrived in Claremont in 1981, after holding positions at the California Institute of Technology, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Leeds University, and Purdue University.\\n\\n> Ellis was responsible for so much of our deeply collaborative approach at IMS and in the broader Claremont math community.

He was the co-founder, with Bob Borrelli at Harvey Mudd College, of a unique organization that draws on the talent and resources of Claremont\\u2019s six independent math programs, the Claremont Center for the Mathematical Sciences (CCMS).\\n\\nCumberbatch continued to be an active member of the IMS faculty well into his retirement, in 2009, including a one-year appointment as dean in 2011-12.\\n\\nCumberbatch is survived by his long-term partner, Suzanna Stafford, and children from his first marriage, Guy, Louis, and Evelyn Cumberbatch; his daughter Ellen is deceased. He is also survived by grandchildren including Guy\\u2019s children, Adam and Christopher Cumberbatch, and Evelyn\\u2019s children, Boaz and Lily Kaffman. Suzanna\\u2019s daughter, Jeni Hess Brage, and Jeni\\u2019s two children, Shelby and Cassidy Brage, were also close to him.

The act of teaching alone is not social justice if we are not teaching in ways that honor our students and communities. For us, critical social justice is not an empty gesture or a checklist, but rather a challenging, humbling, love-soaked, reflective practice that takes practice. We operate from the premise that schools are not neutral because they contain and reflect the inequities deeply and structurally embedded within our nation. Therefore, we support our students in understanding this landscape so they can:\\n\\n*   Actively seek and make change that disrupts inhumane, unjust, and inequitable patterns and practices.\\n*   Affirm and empower students (households, communities, colleagues, and ourselves) to harness the resources needed to navigate an unjust world with empathy, savvy, and agency.\\n*   Dismantle systems and practices of oppression and reimagine love-soaked, empowering ecologies.\\n\\nTo enact our values, we developed Critical Social Justice Competencies that guide our faculty\\u2019s and students\\u2019 teaching practices, we elevate scholarship and experiences of diverse voices, and we center collective wellness and community in everything we do.\\n\\nProgram At-a-glance\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   CA Preliminary Teaching Credential and MA/MS in Education or Mathematics\\n    \\n    degree awarded\\n    \\n\\n*   Spring, Summer\\n    \\n    program start\\n    \\n*   12-24 months | full time\\\\*\\n    \\n    estimated completion time\\n    \\n\\nFaculty\\n-------\\n\\n*   ![Image 1: Portrait of Delacy Ganley](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ganley_DeLacy_1000-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### DeLacy Ganley\\n    \\n    Dean, School of Educational Studies  \\n    Professor of Education\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Culturally relevant education; resiliency and achievement of marginalized populations; intersection of families, community, and school; language acquisition; social capital theory; systems theory\\n    \\n*   ![Image 2: Rebecca Hatkoff](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rebecca-Hatkoff-1024x1024-Template-1-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Rebecca Hatkoff\\n    \\n    Interim Director of Teacher Education and Clinical Assistant Professor\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Critical Social Justice Teaching Competencies; Classroom and School Ecology; Effective and Empowering Pedagogy for all Students, Teacher Candidates, and Teachers; Strength-Based Views of Schools, Teachers, Students, Households, and Communities\\n    \\n*   ![Image 3: Claudia Bermudez](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bermudez1024x1024Web-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Claudia Berm\\u00fadez\\n    \\n    Clinical Assistant Professor  \\n    Preliminary Program Coordinator  \\n    Department of Teacher Education\\n    \\n*   ![Image 4: Samara Suafoa](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Samara-Suafoa-1024x1024-Template-1-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Samara Suafo\\u2019a\\n    \\n    Clinical Assistant Professor  \\n    Assistant Director of Department of Teacher Education.\\n    \\n*   ![Image 5: Laureen Adams](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Laureen-Adams-1024x1024-Template-1-300x300.jpg)\\n    \\n    #### Laureen Adams\\n    \\n    Adjunct Faculty, Allies of Dreamers Certificate program\\n    \\n    Research Interests\\n    \\n    Teacher education, urban teacher preparation and resilience, schooling experiences of Black students, teacher and student relationships, teacher care, culturally sustaining pedagogy, critical race theory, liberatory education, healing, qualitative methodologies, Africana studies\\n    \\n\\nCurriculum\\n----------\\n\\n### Pathways to Certification\\n\\n##### PROGRAM LENGTH: 12-18 MONTHS\\n\\n#### Residency\\n\\n*   Emulates the immersive nature of medical residencies with personalized training.\\n*   Earn your credential and MA in one year.\\n*   Provides hands-on classroom experience under a mentor, with progressively increasing responsibilities.\\n*   Unpaid, but district partnerships can provide a $25,000 living stipend and hiring advantages post-completion.\\n\\n##### PROGRAM LENGTH: 18-24 MONTHS\\n\\n#### Internship\\n\\n*   Paid program, with an average salary of $45,000 per year.\\n*   Ideal for experienced educators desiring full-time pay and benefits.\\n*   Candidates find and apply for the internship with guidance from CGU.\\n*   Complete a full year as the teacher of record in your classroom.\\n*   Start in spring with a pre-internship student teaching placement.\\n*   Opportunities to work in local school districts.\\n\\nProgram Components\\n------------------\\n\\n#### Graduate and Clinical Coursework\\n\\n*   **Teaching and Learning Process Series (4 parts):**\\u00a0These courses are virtual and synchronous, blending culturally responsive theory with practical applications.

Because of the tremendous demands placed on leaders, burnout eventually results in lower productivity, performance, and motivation, as well as increased levels of depression and anxiety (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Baltes & Clark, 2009; Laschinger et al., 2015; Maslach et al., 2001). Some of the best evidence-based cures for burnout are modifications to the work environment, for example, redesigning work to increase motivation and work engagement. Examples include implementing flexible work hours to promote work-family balance or decreasing your workload. Other suggestions include enhancing the comfort of the workspace by adjusting temperature, noise, and crowding (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Laschinger et al., 2015; Reuter & Schwarzer, 2009).\\n\\nBut what if you don\\u2019t have the power to put those changes in place? Leaders with limited resources, such as those in the non-profit sector or smaller businesses, often cannot take advantage of these evidence-based strategies because they require dramatic changes to the organization. However, one thing everyone can do is engage in a _recovery process_. The recovery process centers on _disengagement_, defined as a separation from the emotional, mental and physical stresses of work. You can think of the recovery process as building up a temporary wall between you and your job. Doing so entails the four simple steps of _psychological detachment_, _relaxation_, _mastery_, and _control_ (Sonnentag, Mojza, Demerouti, & Bakker, 2012; Fritz, & Sonnentag, 2005). Each step has easy-to-use strategies to combat burnout.\\n\\nThese four strategies may seem like common sense, but these techniques are under-utilized. Why? For the very reason that people do not engage in recovery activities \\u2013 they believe it is a waste of time, they are too tired at the end of their work day, or simply don\\u2019t feel they have enough energy. However, very much like exercise, if you use these techniques even for a short duration of time over increasing longer periods, you will begin to see the benefits.\\n\\n1.  Psychological detachment requires you to be physically and mentally \\u201caway\\u201d from work when at home or anywhere outside of the office; similar to taking a vacation from work. Being mentally away from work and actively engaging in non-work related activities allows for the replenishment of your resources. You will return to work invigorated. To achieve psychological detachment, you can actively decide not to engage with work, work-related tasks, and workplace intrapersonal conflicts. Instead, focus on activities that will pull your attention toward the enjoyment of the here and now, such as playing with your children, watching television, or going out with friends. The process of deciding to detach psychologically allows you to erect barriers that keep work out during off-work hours. HINT: Put down the smartphone!\\n\\n2.  Related to psychological detachment is the second aspect, relaxation. Look for activities outside of work that you enjoy, but that demand little effort from you. The aim is to decrease your tension and anxiety. Strategies include relaxation techniques such as practicing controlled breathing, meditation, reading a book, or going for a stroll. Ultimately, the activities can be whatever you find relaxing, so find what works best for you.\\n\\n3.  The third step of the recovery process is mastery. As with the first two aspects of the recovery process, the idea is to disconnect from work by engaging in non-job activities mentally. Detaching and relaxing are one thing, but mastery calls for activities that are not only absorbing but also provide challenging learning experiences. For instance, you can learn a new software package, foreign language, or how to play an instrument. These learning experiences can increase your knowledge, skills, and abilities, which will then transfer to your job and act as new job resources that replace or augment your old ones. As with the previous techniques, any activities that interest you and provide an opportunity for growth can perform this role.\\n\\n4.  The last piece of the recovery process is control. Broadly speaking, if you feel you lack control at work, you should seek autonomy and power in other aspects of your life. If your job is highly regulated, stressful, and prevents you from completing the work in the manner you see as most appropriate or expressing your true feelings then you should use this technique. Control then manifests in how you choose to spend your time off work, whether socializing with friends, spending time with family, or spending a quiet night in and reading a book. Because you make these decisions, you should be left feeling more confident and competent. It\\u2019s not important what the activity is; only that you freely choose it.\\n\\nIn sum, the recovery process is an effective way to overcome burnout because it allows disengagement from work to replenish vital resources. With your resources recovered, you can divert that energy back into your job to continue to manage the organization and achieve organizational goals effectively. The more you engage in the recovery process then, the less time it will take for you to recover each subsequent time and the less likely you will suffer from burnout.\\n\\n### About the Author\\n\\nAgue Mae Manongsong is an Evaluation Associate at LeAD Labs and an MA student in Organizational Behavior and Evaluation at Claremont Graduate University.

Evaluation offers a systematic way to understand issues and perspectives, and uses evidence to explore the implications of different types of strategies and actions.\\n\\nThis workshop will provide an introductory understanding of:\\n\\n*   The difference between project-based performance evaluation and \\u201csystems- thinking\\u201d evaluation approaches.\\n*   How evaluation turns \\u201cfacts\\u201d into a \\u201cstory,\\u201d and \\u201cstory\\u201d into a \\u201ccompelling argument.\\u201d\\n*   The essential role of evaluation in determining impact and learning how and why things work or don\\u2019t work, and ways to improve.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Navigating the Leadership Labyrinth\\n\\n**Michelle Bligh, PhD**\\n\\nAs an area of study, leadership is a very complicated and elusive subject to understand and explain, making it ideally suited to approach from different disciplines and perspectives. Leadership is more than just a collection of tools and tips, or even skills and competencies; the essence of an individual\\u2019s leadership is fundamentally shaped by her or his values, philosophies, and beliefs.\\n\\nIn this workshop, we will examine:\\n\\n*   The leadership labyrinth\\u2014the various challenges and opportunities that uniquely face each individual rooted in gender, race, ethnicity, age, class, citizenship, ability, and experience.\\n*   How to define effective leadership, and how can you develop your identity both as a leader and as a proactive follower.\\n*   How to develop inclusive leadership abilities to respond to the new challenges and changing demands of a global world.\\n*   What successful 21st-century leadership looks like, drawing on theories of philosophy and ethics, charismatic and transformational leadership, and followership.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Evaluation as a Leadership Function\\n\\n**Michael Quinn Patton, PhD**\\n\\nCritical evaluative thinking involves strategic engagement, contextual analysis, situational responsiveness, understanding complex dynamic systems, questioning assumptions, grounding action in evidence, and distinguishing opinions from findings. Evaluative thinking is the foundation for effective leadership that is reality-testing, results-oriented, and learning-focused. Effective leaders have a thirst for knowledge, are not afraid to find out what\\u2019s really going on, and act based on rigorous strategic analysis.\\n\\nThis workshop will cover the four functions of effective leadership:\\n\\n*   Creating and nurturing a results-oriented, reality-testing, learning-focused culture.\\n*   Leading in deciding what outcomes to commit to and hold yourselves accountable for.\\n*   Making the measurement of outcomes thoughtful, meaningful, and credible.\\n*   Using the results\\u2014and modeling for others the serious use of results.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Leadership for Transformative Change in the SDG Era\\n\\n**Michael Quinn Patton, PhD**\\n\\nWe inhabit a world in which an increasing sense of urgency calls for transformational change. The compelling vision represented by the SDGs, the latest data on accelerating climate change, and the global problems that transcend national borders are challenges that require new ways of thinking, acting, and evaluating. Slow, incremental change is not sufficient.\\n\\nBut how do we evaluate change? Evaluators are now involved at the front end, participating in the design of initiatives, bringing to bear accumulated knowledge about what works and what doesn\\u2019t, and ensuring that evaluative thinking is built in from the beginning.\\n\\nThis workshop will examine:\\n\\n*   Program context (e.g., stakeholders, politics, theories of change).\\n*   Dimensions of transformative change that constitute an evaluation framework.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Differences in Evaluation Agendas Between the Global South and North in the SDG Era\\n\\n**Zenda Ofir, PhD**\\n\\n\\u201cDeveloped\\u201d is no longer seen as a stage that has been reached by some countries and that other countries should strive to achieve. The 2030 Agenda emphasizes a more complex reality: All countries share responsibility for development. They do so within the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and the need to respect different national realities, priorities, capacities and levels of development. Yet stark differences remain between the Global South and the Global North. This situation compels us to examine the implications for national development as well as evaluation agendas. Past mistakes have to be avoided, and issues such as development trajectories, policy coherence, the role of culture, resilience, and sustainability need to be considered.\\n\\nThis session will therefore consider the following, with special reference to the Global South:\\n\\n*   Imperatives for national evaluation agendas.\\n*   Innovation in practice: What would evaluation have looked like if invented \\u201chere\\u201d?\\n*   Implications for our evaluation criteria and questions.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Equity and Responsiveness in Monitoring and Evaluation\\n\\n**Katrina Bledsoe, PhD**\\n\\nMonitoring and evaluation are key components to understanding the unique factors that influence policies, programs, governments, and societies. They are also tools that can be used to ensure equity and cultural responsiveness. Equitable and responsive evaluation focuses on who should be involved in decision-making; what questions should be asked and understanding how these questions are contextually grounded; what indicators are most representative of the context; what kinds of data will ensure a more accurate assessment; and in what manner data should be analyzed to enable all voices to be heard.\\n\\nThis workshop will examine:\\n\\n*   What is meant by equity and responsiveness.\\n*   Developing questions with an eye towards equity.\\n*   Developing context-appropriate indicators of progress and success.\\n*   Collecting and analyzing data so that it is representative of the myriad of groups that policies and programs cover.\\n*   Becoming a savvy consumer of evaluation.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Framing the Right Questions and Picking the Right Approach:  \\nAn Overview\\n\\n**Tarek Azzam, PhD**\\n\\nEvery time we try something new, we often ask ourselves, \\u201cIs it better? What makes it good? What is its value? What impact is it having?\\u201d These are common questions that are often used to evaluate anything, from small interventions to large-scale policies. The identification of the most important questions in evaluation is the most important first step in the design process, because it forms the foundation of a useful, credible, and rigorous evaluation. It is important to make sure the questions are driving the choice of methods, and not the other way around.\\n\\nOnce questions have been identified then the evaluation must integrate three facets that impact the design:\\n\\n*   Program context (e.g., stakeholders, politics, maturity of the program, complexity of the program, etc.);\\n*   Evaluators (e.g., level of expertise, theoretical perspectives, competency, etc.);\\n*   Evaluation methods (e.g., type of design, interviews, surveys, case studies, RCTs, etc.).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Behind the Scenes:  \\nUpdates From UN Agency Evaluation Units\\n\\n**UN Agency Representatives**\\n\\nThis session provides the latest insights on the conducting of evaluations globally and at the country level by key units among the UN agencies in New York. Discussions will include the latest findings of what is and isn\\u2019t working under the SDG framework as well as challenges these agencies are facing. In addition, this session incorporates opportunities for question and answer with representatives from United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UN Women, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), and United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (UN OIOS).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### An Introduction to Social Impact Measurement:  \\nThe Role of Evaluation in Private-Sector Organizations with Social Missions\\n\\n**John Gargani, PhD**\\n\\nIncreasingly, private-sector companies are working to advance the public good. They may be called social enterprises, impact investors, or sustainable corporations. This is a critical trend\\u2014the success of the SDGs and the Paris agreement on climate change depends heavily on the participation of the private sector. However, evaluation of their efforts remains a challenge. Companies often engage in social impact measurement, a form of evaluation that incorporates tools, approaches, and theories adapted from finance and management.\\n\\nIn this workshop, our discussion will be grounded in theories and frameworks that will help you understand the role of evaluation in this important area. We\\u2019ll learn about:\\n\\n*   The variety of private-sector actors with social missions, and the contexts in which they work.\\n*   The concept of impact, how it varies, and its relationship to evaluation methods.\\n*   Common standards and frameworks for measuring impact.\\n*   Methods that combine financial analysis and impact measurement, such as social return, on investment.\\n*   Corporate impact reports and how to interpret them.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Follow-Up Project\\n\\nThis project will be introduced to participants at the end of the online segment and then defined during the New York segment. The objective of the project, which will include a month of individualized coaching and mentoring from program faculty and moderators, is to apply the knowledge and skills gained through the training. Projects might include developing terms of reference for evaluating programs related to the SDGs, or developing and implementing an action plan to help a country evaluate progress toward SDGs.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"New York Workshops \\u2014 Claremont Evaluation Center - NY\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cec-ny/programs/elpe/new-york-workshops/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: two pieces of paper with writing on them](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-21-at-1.53.47-PM.png)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-21-at-1.53.47-PM.png)\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 1525 C.E.

It focuses on the nations\\u2019 culturally diverse youth as it examines neurocognitive, genetic, environmental, social, and cultural factors influencing tobacco and alcohol use behavior in order to develop more effective prevention programs.\\n\\nA collaborative effort, the center joins the newly formed School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University with research partners at the [University of Southern California](http://mph.usc.edu/), [SRI International](http://www.sri.com/), and the municipal Centers for Disease Control in three of China\\u2019s largest cities: Chengdu, Qingdao, and Wuhan.\\n\\nThe center\\u2019s specific aims are to investigate the efficacy of tobacco and alcohol use prevention programs (1) across cultures, (2) within specific cultural and environmental contexts, and (3) among individuals, explicitly examining the role of neurocognitive attributes and genetics across these three areas.\\n\\nNeurocognitive and genetic studies that fail to properly account for the environmental, social, and cultural contexts in which tobacco and alcohol use behaviors occur will likely be unsuccessful in identifying and characterizing key traits. Likewise, studies that focus solely on such factors as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and social norms may reach incorrect conclusions if they do not consider individual differences such.\\n\\nInsight into malleable environmental, social, and cultural risk factors provides strong targets for public health intervention at the population level. Understanding the neurocognitive and genetic contribution to these factors, however, is imperative in uncovering the underlying etiology at the individual level.\\n\\nIn addition, a population-level public health intervention that appears to have weak effects overall might indeed have strong effects among a subgroup of the population.

Students from The Claremont Colleges may work simultaneously toward their undergraduate degrees and a Master of Public Health degree with completion of both degrees in five years.\\n\\nSCGH also offers two doctoral programs: a PhD program in Health Promotion Sciences and a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe MPH is a professional degree with a greater orientation toward practice in a public health setting. Graduates obtain careers as practitioners in traditional health departments, managed care organizations, community-based organizations, hospitals, consulting firms, international agencies, state and federal agencies, among others.\\n\\nThe PhD in Health Promotion Sciences is an academic degree that is more research oriented and quantitatively based than the MPH program. As such, the PhD program prepares students for careers in academics and research.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe focus of the DrPH program is on leadership in public health practice, giving it a distinct identity from the PhD degree. In contrast to the PhD degree, the DrPH places greater emphasis on evidence-based practice to execute the three core public health functions (assessment, policy development, and assurance) across local, state, federal, and global settings.\\n\\nAlthough both the PhD and DrPH degrees involve research components, the DrPH focuses on providing leadership to find evidence-based solutions for public health practice versus following narrower lines of research, as is common for the PhD. The DrPH program is grounded in research practice-relevant skills in program evaluation, data acquisition, analysis, interpretation, translation, and dissemination that are essential for developing and implementing critical public health practice activities. The PhD in Health Promotion Sciences provides students with the skills to work primarily in academic settings to design and test new, theory-driven social and behavioral interventions, often in randomized-controlled trials, to determine their efficacy.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe certificate program in the Foundations of Public Health requires completion of five courses, totaling 20 units. If admitted, students may apply these 20 units to the formal degree program in public health.\\n\\nMPH students are required to complete 48 semester hours of coursework, including an internship with a public health agency of their choosing. Full-time students (at least 8 units per semester) take one year to complete the certificate program and five semesters to complete the MPH. Students may enroll part-time.\\n\\nThe PhD program is 72 units, which includes coursework, directed research units, a capstone project, qualifying exam, and dissertation. The DrPH program also requires 72 units, including coursework, an advanced practicum, qualifying exam, and dissertation. Full-time students may complete the doctoral programs in approximately five years.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStudents who have completed graduate-level work prior to enrollment in a doctoral program at CGU may transfer in up to 24 units of coursework. The work must have been completed with at least a grade of B at a graduate institution accredited by a regionally accrediting body and must be shown as relevant to the degree program.\\n\\nUnits from a college or university outside the United States are transferable only if those units were not applied toward the bachelor\\u2019s degree equivalency. Decisions about the acceptability of proposed transfer credit are made by the associate dean for academic affairs.\\n\\nMPH students may transfer in up 10 units of previous graduate coursework.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nStudents may switch into a degree program at SCGH by completing the Certificate/Degree Program Change form\\u00a0available on the CGU Registrar\\u2019s page. Students can add the certificate program to a current degree at CGU.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSCGH offers departmental aid as well as research assistantships on a competitive basis to incoming and returning students.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**GOVERNMENT:**  \\nBlue Shield of California  \\nCalifornia Department of Health Services  \\nCity of Claremont  \\nCity of Montclair Healthy Communities  \\nColorado Department of Public Health & Environment  \\nCounty of San Bernardino Public Health  \\nDenver Environmental Health Department  \\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health  \\nLos Angeles County Department of Health Services  \\nLos Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority  \\nOak Ridge National Laboratory  \\nRiverside University Health System/ Public Health  \\nSanta Barbara County Public Health Department  \\nUS Department of Transportation\\n\\n**HEALTH/HEALTHCARE:**  \\nChildren\\u2019s Hospital Orange County  \\nKaiser Permanente  \\nCity of Hope  \\nCommunity Health Association Inland Southern Region (CHAISR)  \\nHospital Corporation of America  \\nInland Empire Health Plan (IEHP)  \\nM\\u00e9decins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders  \\nUniversity of California Los Angeles Mattel Children\\u2019s Hospital  \\nUnited Nations International Children\\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF)  \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\\n\\n**EDUCATION/HIGHER EDUCATION (Teaching & Research):**  \\nCal Poly Pomona  \\nCalifornia State University Fullerton  \\nCalifornia State University Long Beach  \\nCalifornia State University Los Angeles  \\nClaremont Graduate University  \\nClaremont McKenna College  \\nFlorida International University/Medical School  \\nJohns Hopkins University  \\nLoyola Marymount University  \\nScripps College  \\nTexas A & M Health Science Center/School of Public Health  \\nUniversity of Arizona Health Sciences Center  \\nUniversity of California, Irvine  \\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles  \\nUniversity of California, San Francisco  \\nUniversity of Maryland  \\nUniversity of South Carolina  \\nUniversity of Southern California Keck School of Medicine  \\nUniversity of Texas, Austin  \\nUniversity of Utah Huntsman Cancer Center  \\nWestern University\\n\\n**NONPROFIT/NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS:**  \\nAmerican Cancer Society  \\nAmerican Heart Association  \\nAmerican Lung Association  \\nCenter for Health Justice  \\nCommunity Translational Research Institute (CTRIs)  \\nBeach Cities Health District  \\nBike San Gabriel Valley  \\nHeluna Health  \\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross  \\nMichigan Public Health Institute  \\nPeople Assisting the Homeless (PATH)  \\nPrototypes  \\nPublic Health Advocates  \\nSpecial Services for Groups (SSG)  \\nThe Heritage Education Group  \\nYWCA San Gabriel Valley\\n\\n**AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, UNIVERSITIES, AND COMPANIES**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWe would love for you to visit our campus.

The PRECEDE-PROCEED model, developed in the early 1970s and first published as a text in 1980, has been effectively applied worldwide to address a broad range of health issues: risk factors like tobacco and lack of exercise, social determinants of health such as lack of access to transportation and safe housing, and major disease challenges like heart disease and guinea worm disease. Within in the text, Peterson presents a separate appendix that maps public health competencies to the chapters that address them, allowing instructors to assign readings covering specific topics and to develop relevant assessment activities for students as they progress in their respective public health degrees. Prior to this text she co-edited a third edition of\\u00a0_Health Promotion in Multicultural Populations_\\u00a0(Sage, 2014).

Recognizing now that Ericson intended to be descriptive, the following should be read instead as an alternative to the atmosphere surrounding much of Mormon Studies at present (which we feel Ericson described quite well). Indeed, his categories formed a helpful basis for our thoughts as we composed the post below, especially in considering how Mormon Studies has been viewed, is presently viewed, and can be viewed in the future._\\n\\nWe feel that with the inauguration of this blog, it is important that we not assume an intuitive definition for \\u201cMormon Studies\\u201d but instead suggest a more rigorous one \\u2013 even if it will be of necessity provisional, open to critique, and requiring revision and clarification. Further, we believe that in the light of recent discussion contrasting Mormon Studies and Mormon apologetics, we must offer our own contrast; however, we do not feel that this contrast represents the only two options for Mormon academia, nor do we feel that dismissive definitions do justice to the effort and thought that has gone into the production of apologetic work. With that in mind, these are our proposals:\\n\\n1.  **Mormon apologetics**\\u00a0assumes, has as ends the conclusions reached by, or takes as decisively authoritative exclusively Mormon epistemologies while interacting with non-Mormon epistemologies and methodologies.\\n    \\n2.  **Mormon theology**\\u00a0seems to be a subset the category of apologetics because it appeals to exclusively Mormon epistemologies. For ecclesiastical, historical, and theological reasons, however, Mormon theology is necessarily speculative in ways apologetics is not; further, the epistemology of Mormon theology -what it labels \\u201ctruth\\u201d- is determined exclusively by its methodology of determining authoritative sources of thought. The impossibility of untangling epistemology and methodology and the difficulty of identifying final sources of theological authority mean that Mormon theology does not solely fit within the apologetic realm; it is independent.\\n    \\n3.  **Mormon Studies**\\u00a0is primarily defined by its study of the churches, peoples, theologies, and other phenomena that trace their roots to the religious movement of Joseph Smith, Jr. When it interacts with exclusively Mormon epistemologies, Mormon Studies analyzes them per se and uses them to delineate the scope of studies, but does so in the context of and interacting with non-Mormon academic epistemologies. Through the Mormon Studies discipline Mormons, Mormonism, and the Mormon experience can motivate adaptation and nuance in the non-Mormon methodologies and theories deployed.\\n    \\n\\nThere are many reasons why these definitions, in our opinion, are advantageous. For one, the first is not necessarily pejorative. Apologetics can exist in various degrees of rigor; it is not necessarily quality of thought or analytic insight that differentiates them from standard academic discourse. In addition, apologetics in this schema cannot only be used to describe Mormon varieties thereof, but also the revisionists and anti-Mormons Loyd Ericson profiles in his article. One merely has to replace \\u201cMormon\\u201d in the definition with \\u201csecular,\\u201d \\u201cevangelical,\\u201d or, at least, \\u201cnon-Mormon\\u201d to see how it could operate in the inverse. Even while such commentators use epistemologies that are not necessarily exclusively non-Mormon (like textual criticism or historical research), those epistemologies are represented as inherently excluding significant portions of Mormonism or the Mormon experience. The hypotheses forwarded by both Mormon apologists and anti-Mormons originate within their respective confrontational ideologies, and they are tested to prove or suggest their exclusive factual veracity.\\n\\nMormon Studies, on the other hand, does not interrogate Mormon epistemologies in order to counteract or vindicate them. The import of this arises particularly when we consider how Mormon Studies addresses more than just the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Mormon apologetics, on the other hand, colloquially refers only to the LDS Church and its teachings. On the contrary, Mormon Studies treats epistemologies descended from Joseph Smith, his teachings, and his followers -of whatever denomination- as subjects of study and as manners of circumscribing research questions. This second purpose, research circumscription, allows us to distinguish, among other things, between various Mormon branches in our work: the LDS Church, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the Community of Christ, among others. Faith, doctrine, and testimony, beyond mere organizational distinctiveness, are exclusively Mormon epistemologies that divide these groups one from another.\\n\\nMoreover, our definition of Mormon Studies does not cast the relationship between academic and Mormon epistemologies and methodologies as a one-way street running from the college quad to Temple Square. Richard Bushman has in the past evoked a \\u201cMormon hermeneutics of suspicion,\\u201d which suggests to us that Mormons, Mormonism, and the Mormon experience can illuminate, influence, and alter academic theories and methods, helping them to capture the human experience throughout history and across religions and cultures with greater comprehensivity and richness.[1](http://claremontmormonstudies.org/toward-mormon-studies-part-2-of-2/#fn1-23 \\\"Richard L.

We understand that they are neither final nor comprehensive, and have the potential to raise many of their own questions. However, we put them forward as a peace offering, hoping that they can clear the air and help forge a new way forward.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1.  Richard L.

To conduct an interview you will need:\\n\\n*   \\u2013 recording equipment (which you might already own)\\n*   \\u2013 a quiet place to speak with your narrator for one to two hours\\n*   \\u2013 the [Agreement to Participate form](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Agreement-to-Participate-Claremont-Global-Mormon-Oral-History-Collection-.docx) \\\\[Word Doc\\\\]\\n*   \\u2013 the [Oral History Project Summary form](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Global-Mormon-Oral-History-Project-Summary-Form-1.docx) \\\\[Word Doc\\\\]\\n*   \\u2013 the [Oral Life History Suggested Questions form](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Oral-Life-History-Suggested-Questions.docx) \\\\[Word Doc\\\\]\\n\\nEquipment\\n---------\\n\\nYou may very well already own all the equipment you need to successfully record a one or two-hour interview. Your tablet, laptop, or smart phone might already contain recording capabilities, and if not, they can usually be obtained for free from app stores. Apps like Smart Recorder have been used successfully by other interviewers. Just be sure that the recording file (preferably in .wav or .mp3) can be emailed to and accessed from a computer. Also, be sure there is sufficient room on your phone or tablet for the recording. You may want to use two devices just to be safe in case one fails or runs out of space.\\n\\nA digital voice recorder that exports files to computers is also a great option and can be obtained relatively inexpensively. The Olympus Digital Voice Recorder WS-852 should work very well, but be sure to experiment with recording, saving, and transferring your files before you begin your interview.\\n\\nAgreement to Participate Form\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThe [Agreement to Participate form](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Agreement-to-Participate-Claremont-Global-Mormon-Oral-History-Collection-.docx) is essential. This is an informed consent document, laying out what the project is, who is eligible to participate, what the terms of participation are, and the narrator\\u2019s options in regard to confidentiality. He or she can choose to be identified by name on the audio recordings and transcriptions, or he or she can choose to remain anonymous in perpetuity, in which case the audio file will not be archived, but the transcriptions (stripped of names) will be. This form must be signed and dated for the interview to be accepted into the archive. If your narrator does not speak English, you will need to translate the Agreement to Participate Form into a language your narrator does understand. For help with translation of this document, contact caroline.kline2@cgu.edu.\\n\\nA Quiet Place\\n-------------\\n\\nInterviews are most successful when conducted in quiet and private places, such as people\\u2019s homes. Skype or Google Chat interviewing is possible if you make sure your connection is clear and volume high.\\n\\n![Image 1: two people talking](https://mormonstudies.cgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/conversation-300x200.jpg)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOral Life History Suggested Questions\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThis one page outline of questions covers personal history (childhood, marriage, profession, challenges in life, etc.), experiences with church and society, and reflections on religious beliefs. You do not need to ask every single question, but please be sure to ask a handful from each section. Especially important are their thoughts on their experiences as Mormons in their particular countries. If there are other questions that you think should be asked, please feel free to do so.\\n\\nHow to Conduct an Interview\\n---------------------------\\n\\nFirst, please send or show your narrator your anticipated interview questions beforehand. He or she should have a sense as to the types of questions you\\u2019ll be asking. You may also want to show your narrator the Agreement to Participate beforehand.\\n\\nWhen you arrive at your narrator\\u2019s home, begin by going over the Agreement to Participate with your narrator and answer any questions she may have. Once she signs it, have her fill out the Summary form. Second, turn on the recorder and introduce yourself, say the date, and say who you are interviewing. Then launch into your first question.\\n\\nConducting an oral life history interview is a wonderful opportunity to hear someone deeply and reflectively speak about his life. Be responsive to your narrator, and feel free to interject follow up questions or quick comments. It is perfectly fine for the tone of the interview to be conversational and informal. If your narrator has a particular story he wants to tell, let him tell that story, even if it means covering fewer questions.\\n\\nAs soon as you are done, transfer the recording file to your computer, and email the audio file, the Agreement to Participate form, and the Summary form to caroline.kline2@cgu.edu.

Prior to joining the SCGH faculty, Shono was a research assistant professor in the Outcomes and Measurement Science Hub within the Department of Medical Social Sciences (MSS) at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM). He received his PhD in Health Promotion Sciences with a concentration in neurocognitive sciences from Claremont Graduate University. He subsequently completed an NIAAA postdoctoral fellowship in alcohol research at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle and held a research scientist position at Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. He also earned his MA in Psychology (experimental cognition) from the City College of New York at the City University of New York and worked as a research statistician at the Hawai\\\\`i State Department of Health.\\n\\nShono\\u2019s broad research interests center around the intersection of neurocognitive science, health behaviors, cognitive and health outcomes, and applied psychometrics and statistics. His primary research seeks to understand different classes of cognitive processes (e.g., implicit cognition, memory, executive functions, processing speed) and their relations to health behaviors (e.g., substance use, risky sex, physical activity) and health outcomes (e.g., mild cognitive impairment, dementia, physical functioning, depression). Another area of his research focus is applied psychometric investigations using classical and modern test theory to better address and understand measurement and psychometric issues pertaining to measures of cognition and health behaviors and outcomes. He is presently working on projects collaborating with NUFSM on validating and improving the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (and its variant cognitive measures), which is used nationwide in medical practice to measure cognitive functioning and other medical outcomes (e.g., early indicators of cognitive impairment). As a senior data analyst, consultant statistician, and co-investigator, he has provided analytic, psychometric, and methodological support on numerous NIAAA, NIDA, NIA, and NIMHD and other national and international research projects.\\n\\nAt CGU, Shono teaches applied statistics classes required of MPH and doctoral students, provides statistical and methodological support and consultation to SCGH faculty and students, and serves as co-director of the Master of Science in Applied Statistics program.\\n\\nCo-authored with K.

His mother, the fourth wife, arranged for him to be raised by her brother, and he lived with this uncle from the age of six until nineteen. Following in his uncle\\u2019s footsteps, he worked in agriculture for several years in Lagos, Nigeria\\u2019s largest city. He eventually moved to Ibadan because his wife did not want to live in Lagos.\\n\\nTransitioning to life in Ibadan was difficult, as it was challenging to find work since he didn\\u2019t have connections there. After several years he found work in trading. Looking back on his life, he reflects that he would have liked to be a medical doctor, but his poverty prevented that. However, his oldest daughter is now a medical doctor. He and his wife were able to send all four of their daughters to university.\\n\\nJames joined the Church in 1997 after investigating it for two years. He was initially attracted to the messages he found in his friend\\u2019s Liahona magazine, and his interest was further sparked when missionaries brought him a pamphlet which featured a painting of Jesus that he had dreamed of years before. His wife and daughters are members of the Church as well. After being sick much of his life, he now finds himself healthier, and he attributes it to following the Word of Wisdom. He hopes that other members of the church in Nigeria will strengthen in their commitment to the gospel and live up to the standards that it teaches.\\n\\n![Image 2: the church of jesus christ of later day saints](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/07/Adedokun5.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"James Bodejo Adedokun - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/adedokun/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Misti Hatfield is Admissions Coordinator at Claremont Graduate University.\\u00a0In her role, she provides technical and operational support to members of the university\\u2019s admissions and recruitment staff and leads the Office of Admissions\\u2019 team of student workers.\\n\\nMisti joined CGU in 2015 with prior professional experience in admissions and communications at Victor Valley College\\u2019s Nursing Program.\\u00a0Over her career, she has specialized in project management, process mapping, and data maintenance.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Misti Hatfield - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/people/misti-hatfield/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[![Image 1: Gadgach Temple Vishnu and Lakshmi Sandstone Sculptures](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/n20100423a_sqligallerysliderimage.jpg)](https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/01/n20100423a_sqligallerysliderimage.jpg)  \\n_Gadgach Temple Vishnu and Lakshmi Sandstone Sculptures_\\n\\n**Year of Object(s) Creation:** 11th or 12th Centuries  \\n**Estimated Value ($USD):**  \\n**Object Type(s):**  \\n**Object Material(s):**  \\n**Provenience Nation:** India  \\n**Provenience Location:** GadgachTempleintheRajasthanstate  \\n**Year Removed from Findspot:**\\n\\n**Provenance**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Start Year:**\\n\\n**End Year:**\\n\\n**Circumstance of Acquisition:** Alleged looting\\n\\n**Nation:** India\\n\\n**Location:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Description:**  \\n\\\"Vishnu and Lakshmi\\\" sandstone sculpture from the 11th or 12th century - Religious icons\\n\\n**Case Status:** Object(s) relinquished  \\n**Year Claim Initiated:** 2009  \\n**Year Claim Resolved:** 2014  \\n**Means of Resolution:**\\n\\n**Complainant Name:** Government  \\n**Complainant Nation:** India  \\n**Complainant Nation Economy:** In Transition  \\n**Complainant Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Respondent Name:** Government  \\n**Respondent Nation:** United States  \\n**Respondent Nation Economy:** Developed  \\n**Respondent Type:** Public: Government\\n\\n**Reference Links:**\\n\\n**Files:**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Editor's Notes:**\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Indian Gadgach Temple Vishnu And Lakshmi Sandstone Sculptures \\u2014 Cultural Property Disputes Resource\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/cultural-property-disputes-resource/cpdr/gadgach-temple-vishnu-and-lakshmi-sandstone-sculptures/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"Case Status\\n\\nObject Type\\n\\nObject Material\\n\\nMeans of Resolution\\n\\nComplainant Nation\\n\\nRespondent Nation\\n\\nProvenience Nation\\n\\nSort By\\n\\nSort Order\\n\\n_Each record designates a unique dispute, which may involve one or more objects.

To observe differences in neural activity of alcohol-relevant associative effects, the proposed project will involve a between subjects comparison of hazardous alcohol users and light alcohol users on validated tests of implicit memory and cognition (a cue-behavior-outcome association task and alcohol-related-Implicit Association Test). By eliciting activation of associative alcohol-relevant memories through performance on these indirect tests of association, it is possible to increase our understanding of individual differences in associative structures that influence alcohol and other substance use behavior.\\n\\nInvestigators\\n-------------\\n\\n![Image 1: Susan Ames](https://research.cgu.edu/scgh/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2016/11/ames3.jpg)  \\n[**Susan L.

In fact, the comments above are drawn from the recipients of just one such fellowship, made possible by an estate gift from Joseph and Jean Platt.\\n\\n**Meet Joe and Jean**  \\nJoe Platt served as the eighth president of Claremont Graduate University (known then as Claremont Graduate School and University Center) from 1976 to 1981. A physicist by trade, he was a strong believer in the liberal arts model of education. Under his leadership the University launched new programs in management, policy and music.\\n\\nAfter his presidency, Joe and his wife, Jean, continued to contribute in a variety of ways to the University's growth and excellence until they were both well into their 90s. When Joe and Jean passed away within a year of each other in 2012 and 2013, their estate generously provided CGU with yet another gift: endowed fellowship support that will benefit students for decades to come.\\n\\n**Remembering Mom and Dad**  \\nIn remembering their parents, Elizabeth Platt Garrow and Ann Platt Walker are not surprised by such thoughtful generosity.\\n\\n\\\"Jean and Joe Platt embraced, lived and encouraged scholastic and humanitarian efforts,\\\" the sisters wrote recently. \\\"It was their wish to provide opportunities for CGU scholars and fellows to advance these goals locally, nationally and globally. They would both be pleased and excited to follow the recipients' progress and accomplishments.\\\"\\n\\n**Reaching Future Generations**  \\nThe academic opportunities that Joe and Jean have made possible will have an impact on CGU for many years to come.\\n\\n\\\"The Platts' generosity serves as an inspiration to me and I am happy to be a part of such an amazing legacy,\\\" says Drew Clinkenbeard, this year's fellowship recipient. \\\"It is my hope that I will be able to inspire and assist future generations in pursuing careers in science.\\\"\\n\\n**How Can You Change a Life?**  \\nFor information on how to include CGU in your own estate planning, contact Claremont Graduate University at (909)\\u00a0621-8027 or [plannedgiving@cgu.edu](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/#).\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

Grant and three associates established Asia\\u2019s first continuous mission.[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1) This occurred as the LDS church, freed from government harassment over the practice of polygamy, was beginning to think of extending its proselytizing work to a new field. Japan was a natural choice, given its spectacular rise to the ranks of modern nations in a brief period of time after 220 years of national seclusion; the LDS leaders also favorably remembered the visit in 1872 of a high-level government delegation to Salt Lake City (as part of their round-the-world tour). Almost coincidentally, the promulgation of a written constitution and associated statutes toward the end of the previous century had formally allowed its citizens to practice a religion of their choice and foreign missionaries to travel freely in the interior.\\n\\nThe prewar Japan Mission operated for 23 years from 1901 to 1924, when it closed after seeing 169 convert baptisms. Following the conclusion of World War II, in 1948, the LDS church returned to Japan after 24 years of official absence. Under the postwar Japanese Mission (renamed in 1955 as the Northern Far East Mission), missionary work was scaled up, with an estimated 9,570 individuals embracing the Mormon message before the mission was split in 1968. The number of missionaries assigned to Japan remained small, however. From 1901 to 1924, for a country of about 50 million people, the number averaged 12.5 and never exceeded 20 at any given time; from 1948, the number gradually increased from less than 20 to exceed 100 in the early 1960s for the first time. The church\\u2019s geographical expansion only began from the late 1960s as it multiplied the numbers of missions and missionaries.\\n\\nThe LDS church now claims a membership of about 130,000 in Japan, making it the country\\u2019s second largest nationally registered Christian religious corporation.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2) In fact, it has been among Japan\\u2019s most successful Christian denominations. From 1960 to 2018, its membership grew at an average 6.5 percent per year; the growth, at more than 15 percent per year, was particularly impressive during the period 1970\\u201380. Yet, in this largely non-Christian nation, the church\\u2019s growth performance pales in comparison with such new Buddhist movements as _S\\u014dka Gakkai_ and _Rissh\\u014d K\\u014dseikai_, which claimed millions of converts each over the same period. This should put into perspective any notion of the LDS church\\u2019s success. After more than a century\\u2019s proselytizing work, Latter-day Saints remain a tiny fraction of Japan\\u2019s total population, accounting for no more than 0.1 percent.\\n\\nThe LDS church, along with many other religious groups, faces a challenging future in Japan, posed by the country\\u2019s adverse demographic trend and rising religious indifference. Japan\\u2019s population peaked in 2008 at 128 million and has been declining since, diminishing the pool of young people from which the church has typically drawn its converts. Many religious groups in Japan have been experiencing stagnation, and even an outright fall in some cases, in membership. Non-traditional, non-Christian religions, for example, began to suffer a membership decline from the 1980s; the membership growth of all Christian churches combined has been stagnant since the 1970s (and membership has actually been falling more recently). The LDS church has not yet experienced an outright fall in membership, but its growth virtually stopped in the early to mid-1990s.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Was the Prewar Japan Mission a Failure?\\n\\nMost of the extant writings on Mormonism in Japan are historical and devotional in nature; and the quality of scholarship is mixed. The few scholarly works have utilized archived official and personal records (mostly housed in the LDS church historical department) and American missionary journals (some of which are archived both in the LDS church historical department and in the special collection libraries at Brigham Young University and the University of Utah) to elucidate interesting episodes in prewar Mormon experience. Murray Nichols was a pioneer in this approach.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3) His master\\u2019s thesis submitted to BYU in 1957 presents a comprehensive history of the Japan Mission based, among other things, on the newly located journals of Alma O. Taylor, an early missionary who remained in Japan from 1901 to 1909. Nichol\\u2019s thesis and Taylor\\u2019s journals are both available electronically from the BYU library.\\n\\nOther scholars followed suit, utilizing new primary sources. Lanier Britsch discusses the circumstances that led to the closing of the prewar Japan Mission in 1924.[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4) Christopher Conkling provides a historical account of member activities during the period of no official LDS church presence.[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5) Ronald Walker, based in part on the journals of Heber J. Grant, a Mormon apostle who served as the first mission president in Japan, gives an interesting account of early Mormon experience.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6) These studies are reprinted in a volume edited by Reid Neilson and Van Gessel, which also includes additional studies and a useful chapter entitled \\u201cMormonism and the Japanese: A Guide to the Sources.\\u201d[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\nReid Neilson, based on his doctoral dissertation at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, takes an analytical approach to early Mormon history in Japan.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8) He asks why the number of converts (at 169) was so small, especially compared to the tens of thousands of converts that the Catholic and Protestant churches were able to claim during the prewar period. Neilson\\u2019s thesis is that the relative success of the mainline Christian churches came from their emphasis on education work, which was more adapted to Japanese society. In contrast, the Mormons \\u201cmerely imposed or translated their message\\u201d almost exclusively through \\u201cpersonal contacting.\\u201d[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nI am not sure if Neilson\\u2019s explanation takes sufficient account of the diverse approaches and experiences evinced by the Catholic and Protestant missionaries in Japan. Regardless, his whole argument is based on the fundamental premise that the prewar mission was a failure, a view widely shared by students of early Mormon history in Japan. He is in good company. A person of no less authority than Gordon B. Hinckley (the LDS church\\u2019s 15th president, 1995\\u20132008) characterized the prewar Mormon experience in Japan as \\u201ca work of devotion and disappointment probably without parallel in the history of the missions of the Church.\\u201d[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10) I discuss this topic at some length in my book _The Trek East_.[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11) My conclusion is that the number of converts was small because the number of missionaries was small.\\n\\nFrom 1901 to 1924, the total number of missionaries sent to Japan was less than 0.5 percent of the global total. If each mission had received an equal allocation, the number of missionaries sent to Japan would have been about ten times the actual number; and the number would have been even larger if the allocation had been made in proportion to the population of the country. If you divide the number of convert baptisms by the number of missionaries, the average was 0.58 baptisms per missionary per year, with a discernible rising trend. In fact, the average for the 1915\\u201322 period, at 1.02,[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) was higher than the productivity of LDS missionary work in Japan observed in recent years.\\n\\nIt is true that the Japan Mission was not as productive as some of the other missions: a comparable figure for the Swiss\\u2013German Mission, then the LDS church\\u2019s highest baptizing mission, was 16.6 for the period 1919\\u201324. Even so, if the Japan Mission had received the same number of missionaries (ninety missionaries at the end of 1920), the same productivity observed for the nine missionaries serving in Japan would have produced 100 baptisms, placing it in eighteenth place (or eleventh place outside the United States) out of the twenty-five existing missions of the church. This would have been almost the same number as the Australian and Norwegian Missions (with 102 baptisms each), more than the French (62) and Swedish (54) Missions, and slightly below the Canadian Mission (121).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Why Was the Japan Mission Closed?\\n\\nGiven such a widely held view that the Japan Mission was a failure, it comes as a surprise to serious students of Mormon history that what has emerged as the dominant explanation of the prewar mission\\u2019s closing is political: it was due to the deterioration in the Japan\\u2013United States relationship (needless to say, my view is that it was closed mainly because the church leaders considered it a failure). In 1948, on the occasion of the reopening of missionary work in Japan, an editorial in the LDS church periodical _Improvement Era_ attributed the withdrawal of missionaries in 1924 to \\u201cintense nationalism, fanned by ambitious militarists, \\\\[which\\\\] discouraged every foreign contact and stifled every breath of personal freedom and privilege.\\u201d[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13) Mormon belief in prophetic power added another dimension to this narrative. Hilton A. Robertson, the mission president who was instructed to close the mission, remarked at the April 1947 general conference: \\u201cI feel that the Lord knew what was going to transpire and he called the missionaries home \\u2026 Later on we find that the other denominations \\u2026 were forced to close their missions and return to America at great loss and sacrifice.\\u201d[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\nThis is another topic I discuss at length in _The Trek East_. Suffice it to say that those who have related the mission\\u2019s closing to the Pacific War in some way all made their remarks from the vantage point of the postwar era, when the war and the events in Japan that had led up to it were a fait accompli. In 1924, the war was more than seventeen years away; events could still have gone either way, and war may well have been averted with a different sequence of political decisions.\\n\\nTo be sure, there was a latent rise in nationalism, militarism, and totalitarianism, but the rest of the 1920s and the early 1930s in Japan actually witnessed a remarkably improved relationship with the United States in commerce and culture. The United States remained Japan\\u2019s most important trading partner; a number of prominent American companies came to Japan to form joint ventures or to build production facilities. Things American, from Hollywood movies to Major League baseball, flooded the Japanese market.\\n\\nMissionary work by other Christian denominations went on as usual. Certainly, no major denomination left Japan; some new Christian mission organizations, numbering at least twenty-nine, arrived in Japan between 1925 and 1938. Among them was the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, whose pacifist teachings resonated with the Japanese society of the late 1920s. In the early months of 1940, Christian missionaries were still able to carry out their assignments without hindrance from the authorities and missionaries were being sent to Japan from their headquarters.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) While it was the LDS church\\u2019s prerogative to decide whether and when to leave Japan, one must keep in mind that it did so during a period of relative success and when the country\\u2019s religious climate held some promise, in order to make a proper historical assessment of that decision.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Growth, Stagnation, and the Future of Mormonism\\n\\nThe devotional narrative on the postwar Mormon experience is the exact opposite of the narrative for the prewar experience: it was an astounding success. Lanier Britsch, writing for an LDS church periodical, characterizes the \\u201cblossoming\\u201d of the church as \\u201cimpressive by any standard,\\u201d attributing the presumed success to postwar reforms, especially the disbanding of State Shinto.[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) It is true that important postwar reforms led to profound socio-cultural changes in Japan; in the realm of religious belief and practice, the social costs of switching religions are now probably much smaller than they were in the prewar period. Even so, I believe that socio-cultural factors explain only a small part of the postwar growth of the LDS church. The church has made little institutional acculturation to adapt its teachings and practices to Japanese society. It has therefore only appealed to a small fraction of the population. Even an unadulterated foreign cult can attract a small following in any socio-cultural setting.\\n\\nIn a recent paper, Meagan Rainock and I formally unbundled the sources of LDS membership growth among various competing factors, such as the number of missionaries, demographics, and a measure of societal religiosity.[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17) We used two proxies for the level of religiosity: (i) growth in the number of nationally registered Christians excluding Latter-day Saints and (ii) growth in the number of non-Shinto, non-Buddhist adherents excluding Christians. Applying an ordinary least squares regression model for the years 1975\\u20132017, we found that as much as 60 percent of annual membership change could be explained by the number of missionaries and demographics, with religiosity playing an additional but marginal role. This implies that, unlike many other Christian and non-traditional religions, the LDS church has not yet experienced an outright decline in membership only because evangelical work has offset the decline in membership due to demographics and natural attrition.\\n\\nThis finding does not bode well for the future of the LDS church in Japan. Adverse demographics is here to stay. Japan is the world\\u2019s most rapidly aging society. If the current trend continues, the country is expected to lose about a quarter of its population by the year 2050.\\n\\nOn its part, the LDS church has been assigning fewer missionaries to Japan. The average number of missionaries declined from about 1,300 during 1975\\u201395 to about 810 during 1996\\u20132013 even as the church-wide number increased (following a temporary pickup when the eligibility age was reduced in 2012, the number has since dropped further to around 600). On top of this, attrition, high for any Christian denomination in Japan, is especially high among the Latter-day Saints. In fact, the LDS church\\u2019s ratio of active to total members (at less than 20 percent) is the lowest of any Christian denomination in Japan, for which church attendance data are available.[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nThe lower member activity of the LDS church in Japan may be an indication that the social costs of remaining an \\u201cactive\\u201d member are higher for the LDS church than for other Christian denominations. In contrast, the activity rate is much higher for such indigenous churches as the Spirit of Jesus Church (43.0 percent) and the Holy Ecclesia of Jesus (52.7 percent), which have pushed the cultural adaptation of Christianity to the limit. The LDS church\\u2019s lack of institutional adaption means that acculturation has been taking place at the individual level (acceptance of a foreign religion requires acculturation at some level) and has collectively created a hybrid culture that is neither Japanese nor American. The resulting cultural distance from the rest of society, compounded by the prevalence of transliterated words and other non-traditional language out of line with conventional colloquial usage, is a barrier preventing the LDS church from becoming acceptable to a larger population.\\n\\nYet, the simple argument for greater indigenization of the LDS does not follow. A well-known theorem in the sociology of religion, attributable to Rodney Stark, posits that, for a new religion to thrive, it requires a moderate level of tension with the host society. Consistent with this theorem, most of the indigenous Christian denominations in Japan, after prospering for some time, now appear to be heading toward institutional extinction. Speaking of such Christian groups in 1998, Mark Mullins, presciently observed that while Christianity was \\u201ctoo deviant for widespread acceptance by Japanese,\\u201d churches could \\u201cdig their own graves through \\u2018over-indigenization.\\u2019\\u201d[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Directions for Mormon Studies on Japan\\n\\nOnly limited analytical work exists on the contemporary Mormon experience in Japan. This is understandable. Few scholars are bilingual in Japanese and English, to begin with, and, for those rare scholars, doing serious work on Mormonism in Japan does not pay in terms of academic recognition. If Mormonism is a niche in Japan\\u2019s religious world, so is Mormon studies on Japan in academia. In my own life, Mormon studies (alas, with a focus on Japan) has been little more than a hobby, something I do during my \\u201cfree\\u201d time (and I started Mormon studies only after I was reasonably established in my own home discipline). Perhaps this situation may change for the better in coming years, as genuine interest continues to strengthen in Mormonism as a world religion.\\n\\nLooking to the future, abundant information available on the contemporary Mormon experience (even in Japan) argues against taking the dominant historical approach of the past. I can think of only a few areas where the conventional mode of inquiry may still be useful (e.g., Jiro Numano\\u2019s work on the controversial \\u201chasty baptism\\u201d era of the early 1980s).[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20) There is thus little to discover, but much to explain. What is needed is an explicitly social-scientific analysis of Japanese culture and society, and how they interface with Mormonism. My own sociological work with Meagan Rainock provides a glimpse of how such an approach may work in practice. John Hoffman\\u2019s analysis of the quality characteristics of Japanese Mormons in a small LDS branch in Hokkaido is likewise a promising start.[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21)\\n\\nUltimately, the question of why the LDS church remains a niche religion in Japan can only be answered within the broader question of why Christianity likewise remains so. Lanier Britsch makes a first worthwhile attempt to explain cultural barriers to the wider acceptance of Mormonism in Japan, but the argument is not fully convincing.[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22) A phenomenon (e.g., religious acceptance) cannot be explained by another phenomenon (e.g. Japan\\u2019s group orientation; status consciousness; lack of individualism);[\\\\[23\\\\]](#_ftn23) phenomena are the outcome of deeper, fundamental causes. I believe that we must go much beyond cultural and social phenomena to provide a fully satisfactory explanation. In my book _The Trek East_, I assumed the perspective of an intellectual historian to explain prewar Japan\\u2019s changing attitude toward Christianity. This approach served the modest purpose at hand (that is, to explain the ebbs and flows of Christian converts, which remained small in absolute value). To explain why the number of Christians (and Latter-day Saints) remains so small relative to the population would seem to require a grander exploration of what fundamentally constitutes a Japanese person.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**References**\\n\\nBritsch, Lanier R., \\u201cThe Closing of the Early Japan Mission,\\u201d _BYU Studies_ 15 (1975): 171\\u201390.\\n\\nBritsch, Lanier R, \\u201cThe Blossoming of the Church in Japan,\\u201d _Ensign_ 22 (October 1992): 32\\u201338.\\n\\nBritsch, Lanier R., \\u201cHistorical and Cultural Challenges to Successful Missionary Work in Japan,\\u201d in R.

I visually render the process of engaging with the unconscious, revealing the tension between self-exposure and self-concealment. I dream vividly and often, and have been recording my dreams for ten years. Dreams symbolize the unconscious and I am using them to represent the process of making the unconscious conscious. It\\u2019s the process of taking the unknown and making it known: The dreams reveal the self and in the same way the process of making the paintings reveals the dream. I am exploring the moments of recounting the dreams and the outcome of repetition on memory. The moments of time between states is when recounting happens. Similarly, a memory is a leftover of a happening. What is the dialogue between memory and dream, self and other, conscious and unconscious, known and unknown? This work is an exploration of those questions.\\n\\nMy intention is to provide windows into the universal experience of the \\u201cself\\u201d that we all share. On each of the paintings, the windows are represented as repeated frames to convey the fragments of memory, and the shards of the dream that can be recalled. The paintings are a physical as well as a metaphorical palimpsest, showing evidence of the layers and the fragments that constitute dreams and memory. They are created in layers through multiple applications of paint and text. The paintings are literal explorations of the murkiness of the unconscious. Each painting is divided into small frames (windows) containing hand-written text. These fragments are hidden in the paint and visibly rendered, although not always explicitly. In the paintings, the text is written and then erased, sometimes completely, underscoring the complex nature of revealing one\\u2019s self. The language created from these components is a collage of the assemblage of the unconscious, the same way that the dream fragments are a collage of memory.\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Rebecca Rich - MFA '19 - Claremont Graduate University\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/students/rebecca-rich/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"![Image 1: Loading Events](https://www.cgu.edu/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/resources/images/tribe-loading.gif)\\n\\nRestorative Yoga + Sound Bath Sessions\\n\\nThe EmPOWER presents a Spring \\u201824 Restorative Yoga + Sound Bath series.

The unique is not the first of a series, the singular is not an instance of a type, and the individual is not a particular of something general. The problem has a long and complex history, but it also has a pressing actuality at a time when singularity discourses abound. What can we learn from philosophical studies about singular individuals or from theological debates about the unique or from hermeneutical explorations of ways of speaking about the unique, the singular and the individual?\\n\\nThere are longstanding debates in philosophy that have focused on ontological, epistemological, and ethical issues. Leibniz\\u2019s monads, Schleiermacher\\u2019s individuals, Kierkegaard\\u2019s singular individual, and Hartshorne\\u2019s universal individual all contribute to this debate. Leibniz\\u2019 monads are microcosmic mirrors of the universe of irreducible simplicity. For Schleiermacher, individuality is not an ontological given, but the highest ethical value to which humans ought to aspire. For Kierkegaard, too,\\u00a0singularity is an achievement term.\\u00a0We are all part of a multitude, and we become singular only by moving beyond the limitations imposed on us as particulars of the specific multitude to which we belong.\\u00a0And in metaphysics and philosophical theology, Hartshorne argues that if there is no god but God, then God is unique, not only in the sense of being the only one worthy of worship, but in a sense that makes it impossible for us to comprehend God conceptually.\\n\\nThe problem may not only be on God\\u2019s side, but also on ours. Conceptual thinking is a powerful tool for orienting ourselves in the world. But all conceptual thinking simplifies, and all our conceptual schemes and distinctions flounder when it comes to thinking the utterly simple, individual, singular, or unique. Whatever we mean by them, they seem to slip through our networks of terms and escape our distinctions. This has not merely epistemological, but also ethical and hermeneutical implications.\\u00a0If only God is unique, then uniqueness is nothing for which we could or should strive. Our aim can at best be to become singular individuals. In one sense we are all unique by being different from everybody else. Others can replace us in our professional functions and social roles, but not as individual persons. As persons we are all different from each other, but none of us will ever be unique in the sense of being utterly unlike anything else.\\u00a0The unique is not merely distinct from everything else in some respect or another, but something that does not share anything with anything else. But how can anything be radically different from everything else and still be a reality for us? How can we meaningfully communicate about the unique, the singular, the utterly simple, and the strictly individual?\\n\\nDebates about the unique, the singular, and the individual pose epistemological, hermeneutical, metaphysical, ethical, and theological problems. To address them is the objective of the 39th Annual Philosophy of Religion Conference at Claremont, California, on February 23-24, 2018.\\n\\n### [Click here to register for the conference.](http://bit.ly/2tMJier)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"2018 The Unique, the Singular, and the Individual \\u2014 Philosophy of Religion Conference\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/philosophy-of-religion-conference/about/conferences-publications/2018-unique-singular-individual/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Home](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs) \\u00a0\\u203a\\u00a0 Alison Abercrombie, MA\\n\\nLab Manager\\n-----------\\n\\n![Image 1: Alison Abercrombie](https://research.cgu.edu/lead-labs/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2017/12/Alison_Abercrombie.jpg)\\n\\n*   **Degrees**  \\n    MA, Positive Organizational Psychology and Evaluation\\n*   Connect\\n    \\n\\nAlison Abercrombie earned an MA in Positive Organizational Psychology and Evaluation and was the Lab Manager for LeAD Labs and a member of the marketing task force.

One gift helps fund the Roland Reiss Endowed Chair in Art, a senior level faculty position named after a former CGU Art Department chair, while the other gift provides for the fellowship.\\n\\nThe fellowship recipient for 2012-2013 was Leslie Love Stone, a conceptual painter who graduated in May.\\n\\n![Image 1: donor-beverly-benjamin-art.jpg](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-beverly-benjamin-art.jpg)\\n\\n\\\"Kind of Blue\\\" solo exhibition by Leslie Love Stone. Photo courtesy of Leslie Love Stone.\\n\\n\\\"Since coming to Claremont, I've had the great pleasure to meet the Benjamin family\\u2014they are warm, generous, and passionate about education. For me, their fellowship has been a most appreciated invitation to join the community of professional artists and a challenge to stay the course,\\\" Stone said.\\n\\nHelping art students \\\"stay the course\\\" has been the purpose behind the fellowship all along, as Beverly Benjamin explained. After all, Karl himself knew first-hand how challenging it is to establish yourself early on as an artist.\\n\\nA Good Teacher  \\nKarl Benjamin began his college education in 1943 at Northwestern University in Chicago. He later opted to enlist in the U.S. Navy, and after his military service he moved to Southern California. He resumed his studies at what is now known as the University of Redlands. There, he met Beverly. Both eventually received bachelor's degrees and were married.\\n\\nWhile at Redlands, Beverly said, three different career paths were presented to Karl: Heavy equipment operator, salesperson for the Pep Boys auto parts chain, or teacher.\\n\\nInspired by his mother, who taught high school science, Karl opted to enter the classroom.\\n\\n\\\"He had a soft spot in his heart for the fact that his mother had always been such a good teacher and was so prized by her students that at the age of 85 she was still corresponding with them,\\\" Beverly said.\\n\\nKarl began teaching at grade schools in San Bernardino County, eventually moving his growing family to Claremont in 1952. It was around this time when his interest in art emerged. Asked to incorporate art lessons into his students' curriculum, Karl brought them simple, affordable material\\u2014crayons and paper, for example\\u2014and gave them assignments like, \\\"make a rainbow,\\\" according to 2008 interview for an online art journal.\\n\\n\\\"During his years of teaching public school, he was known for bringing out really beautiful things,\\\" Beverly recalled. \\\"He bought the kids oil pastels. Maybe that's where he got the idea about providing a graduate student with enough of a fellowship to buy some materials.\\\"\\n\\nKarl\\u2014who had no formal background or training in art at the time\\u2014eventually decided to pick up a brush himself.\\n\\n\\\"Reverse Jackson Pollock\\\"  \\n\\\"He came to painting rather later,\\\" Beverly said. \\\"He was already teaching sixth grade . . . so he knew how hard it was to be able to afford paint and canvas and the beginnings of a studio.\\\"\\n\\nHis initial attempt, inspired by surrealist Joan Mir\\u00f3, was a critical first step into the world of art. \\\"Boy, that first painting\\u2014big addiction. It just hit in his heart,\\\" Beverly said. By the late 1950s, Karl had focused on geometry and color, and was considered part of a noteworthy small circle of Southern California-based abstract classicists. In 1959, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art organized a show of Karl and others' work that received wide acclaim.\\n\\nAccording to a 2012 New York Times tribute, Karl's \\\"canvases were known for their simple, repeating geometric shapes, gridlike orderliness and fields of exuberant color that almost never bled into one another. It was a style that made him a sort of reverse Jackson Pollock, who epitomized the New York-based Abstract Expressionist school with his epic canvases of seemingly chaotic splashings and drippings.\\\"\\n\\nInterest in his style spiked again during the 1990s when a whole generation of artists\\u2014including CGU art professor David Pagel\\u2014rediscovered it.\\n\\nContinued Giving  \\nKarl also served as an art professor at CGU and Pomona College and at the time of his death he was lauded as \\\"a dedicated mentor to generations of CGU art students.\\\" Even after Benjamin retired, he kept i  \\nn touch with the university, visited students' studios, and attended their exhibitions  \\n\\\"He just loved being part of a graduate school,\\\" Beverly said, and his retirement in the mid-1990s didn't impact his commitment.\\n\\n\\\"When he retired, he had had so many students\\u2014a full class roster full of graduate students,\\\" Beverly said. \\\"The students would come to him and say, \\u2018Could you please find the time to finish out my second year.' Or, \\u2018I'm just coming into this and I need your help.' This would continue for at least 10 years.\\n\\n\\\"And that was his retirement activity,\\\" Beverly said.\\n\\n\\\"These people become good friends, lifelong friends. People who were students of Karl back in 1979, 1980 were still his good friends . . . until the day he died.\\\"\\n\\nIt is through the Benjamin fellowship that Karl's legacy of continued giving lives on.\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad to have my name on this fellowship,\\\" Beverly said. \\\"It's nice to have given something to the school.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2: donor-beverly-benjamin.jpg](https://myplannedgift.cgu.edu/images/c/claremont-graduate-university/donor-beverly-benjamin.jpg)\\n\\nPhoto by Carlos Puma\\n\\nInformation contained herein was accurate at the time of posting.

Perhaps a more suitable title would be \\u201cCryptography and Information Security.\\u201d Cryptography, because it is a fascinating field of study that is also a key technology for achieving security objectives, and security because of its central importance to our emerging \\u201cinformation society.\\u201d Security policies will shape the kind of society we live in, and cryptography will have a major impact on the kinds of security policies that are achievable.\\n\\nInformation security, broadly defined, involves controlling the dissemination of information. It includes issues of privacy, data integrity, authenticity, and authority. Privacy refers to preventing information flow to unintended recipients. Data integrity properties insure that information is correct and undamaged. Authenticity identifies information with a source. Authority describes what actions are permitted by whom. Because of the ease with which information can be copied and transmitted, traditional physical means of control are of limited efficacy. Cryptography gives a way to build logical controls on the flow of information that are largely independent of the physical properties of the devices used to transmit and store information.\\n\\nCryptography lies at the center of this course, but we will be approaching the subject broadly. On the one end, we\\u2019ll look at problems of information security and see how cryptographic tools can be used to solve them. We\\u2019ll also touch on some social issues surrounding the use of cryptography. At the other end, we\\u2019ll explore the mathematical structures from which cryptographic primitives are built.\\n\\nThis course will spend some amount of time on the mathematical and theoretical aspects of cryptography but more time on practical security systems used in daily life and management issues. Such systems include Kerberos, X.509, PKI, Email security such as S/MIME, PGP, the emerging IPSEC, Web security including SSL/TLS and SET and intrusion detection, firewalls and trusted systems. We will also discuss how IS Security is planned and cover concepts of e-risk management as well as legal issues of computer fraud. Several hands-on computer exercises will be done in class. The course will feature external guest speakers who will talk about a range of topics such as Homeland Security, e-commerce security and Healthcare Security.\\n\\nText and Readings\\n-----------------\\n\\n1.

As part of this, and in view of our emphasis on using information technologies, we require that every student in every course must document some aspect of their learning in the course using an e-portfolio.\\u00a0\\u00a0E-portfolios must be done with your Sakai student account.\\n\\nTo satisfy this requirement, an entry in the student\\u2019s e-portfolio must be created with the template page for this course, and it must address the learning objectives for the course and program.\\u00a0\\u00a0These are listed in the matrix above and in the CCO e-portfolio page template for this course.\\n\\nThe instructor will determine whether the entry suitably reflects course- and program-related learning. \\u00a0She/he may ask the student to revise and resubmit the entry. There are many possible suitable entries.\\u00a0 Possible examples include the deliverables for a class project, a paper written as a result of the course, or a series of blog entries.\\u00a0\\u00a0Any entry is acceptable that demonstrates that the student knows more about the course content than she/he did at the beginning of the course.\\u00a0 It is important that the entry be non-trivial, but it need not be a major new undertaking either.\\u00a0 Entries are intended to be a representation of what was learned.\\n\\nThis is a special assignment.\\u00a0\\u00a0It is not used in calculation of your course grade;\\u00a0it is a requirement to get a grade.\\u00a0\\u00a0No final grade other than \\u201cIncomplete\\u201d (except \\u201cUnsatisfactory\\u201d) will be assigned for the course until you have posted a suitable entry to your e-portfolio.\\u00a0\\u00a0Any e-portfolio entry intended to be used to satisfy the requirement for the course must remain in the student\\u2019s CCO e-portfolio for at least one month following the course, to allow time for archival of pages to occur.\\n\\nBecause entries to an e-portfolio provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your learning, we encourage you to create more than the one required entry, to share your entries with your classmates, and to collect entries across your classes\\u2014in effect, creating a online collection of postings about what you have been learning.\\u00a0\\u00a0Such collections have value in expressing to yourself and others what you have learned in your degree program.\\n\\nCourse Requirements\\n-------------------\\n\\n1.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Regular attendance and active participation in class.\\n\\n2.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Preparation of reading and questions assigned to class.\\n\\n3.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Prepare and present the Research Paper\\n\\n4.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Prepare and submit the assigned scribe to class\\n\\n5.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Take mid-term and submitting final projects.\\n\\nGrading\\n-------\\n\\n<table><tbody><tr><td>PKI assignment</td><td><p>5%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Midterm Exam</td><td><p>20%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Practical hands-on projects</td><td><p>25%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Final Research Paper initial proposal<br>Presentation<br>Final research paper</td><td>5%<br>10%<br>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Final Quiz</td><td><p>10%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Class Participation</td><td><p>10%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><p>100%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\\n\\nSchedule (This is suggested only.

Occasional case studies may also be assigned. You will have one week time to turn them in from the time they are handed.\\n\\nSome practical hands-on type of assignments will be given out. Students will be required to run the tools on Windows or Linux machines and test several experiments. A class lab will be created for running these experiments.\\n\\nThere may be one programming assignment. You can use C, C++ or Java.\\n\\nFinal Research Paper & Presentation:\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nStudent groups will turn in a research paper on a particular topic of interest related to the class. You can choose any relevant topic or you can also seek the help of the instructor. Your job would be to research that topic, collect several good papers from conferences and journals and critique them. Then you will write a report in your own words about that topic. The research paper can be any one of the following types:\\n\\n*   A Case Study\\n*   Comparison of new security technology and trends\\n*   Detailed analysis of new software\\n*   A new cryptography algorithm that you will implement and test\\n*   Improve upon a security protocol\\n*   Descriptive study of emerging security applications and systems\\n*   A new solution to an existing security problem\\n\\nEach group will be asked to submit their research problem, and other associated details by the sixth week of class for approval. As soon as it is approved, you must start your research.\\n\\nThe format and other details about the report would be provided in due course. You will also prepare a PowerPoint slide on your topic. Students will be asked to present their report to class.\\n\\n### Late Policy\\n\\nLate work will be accepted at the discretion of the instructor and/or TA and will generally be subject to a penalty unless accompanied by a Dean\\u2019s excuse. Work will not be accepted after graded papers have been returned or solutions released. However, alternative means for making up missed work may be arranged on an individual basis with a Dean\\u2019s excuse.\\n\\n### Policy on Working Together\\n\\nPlease do your own work yourself. Plagiarism is unethical and will not be tolerated. You must give credit wherever it is due. You may neither copy from others nor permit your own work to be copied.\\n\\nYou may of course discuss the lectures and readings with your classmates in order to improve your understanding of the subject. However, all written work must be your own. You are also always free (and encouraged) to come in and ask the TA or instructor for help about anything concerning the course. Please talk to me if you have any questions about this policy.\\n\\nSupplementary reference books:\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe following are some of the extremely useful reference books which might come handy in case you decide to pursue a career in the fields of cryptography and security:\\n\\n*   Ed Skoudis, Counter Hack, 2002, Prentice Hall Inc.\\n*   B.

She attended Southern Utah University and then worked in Las Vegas and San Diego as a secretary by day and a community theater actor by night. After her short marriage to a fellow actor ended, Sherrie finished her degree in history at Southern Utah State University. An opportunity for an internship took her to Sydney, Australia when she was in her late twenties, where she met her husband Bruce. By this time, Sherrie knew that she would be unable to bear children, and Bruce was willing to adopt. Bruce converted to the Church shortly after they married.\\n\\nAdjusting to Australia was difficult at times \\u2013 she found it hard to connect with people in her Sydney ward and felt that not having children made it more difficult to establish friendships with other women. Bruce accepted a job in a remote part of Australia, and this meant that Sherrie was an hour away from the nearest branch. They often didn\\u2019t make it to church because the road was often closed, and she names this time as one of spiritual growth, as she learned to direct her own study of the gospel. She recounts that during those years, \\u201cI learned more about the lines of priesthood authority, and to serve others in my community in providing meals, etc. (Non-members express extreme gratitude for meals when they are not well!) Having your dining room turn into an ordinance room for the blessing of the sacrament is a sacred experience beyond words. It is the most spiritual experience we have ever shared as a family.\\u201d\\n\\nSherrie states that the Church has some challenges in Australia. First, missionary work is difficult as most Australians feel that they are already familiar with Jesus Christ. Second, disparity between the economic situations of Australian Latter-day Saints and Pasifika Latter-day Saints in the region means that there are a variety of needs, and it\\u2019s often difficult for regional church headquarters to meet all those needs. Third, she sees some American culture seeping into Australian church practice.\\n\\nSherrie now lives in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, and is the mother of two daughters. She plans to resume her PhD program in historical masculinity studies once her children are older.\\n\\n![Image 2: Sherrie Gavin](https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/01/Sherrie.jpg)\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Sherrie Morreal Gavin - The Mormonism and Migration Project\", \"source\": \"https://research.cgu.edu/mormonism-migration-project/people/gavin/\"}}", "{\"page_content\": \"[Does Laura Zucker Owe Meryl Streep a Thank You?

Our methods of study are critical: not only exposing the ideological dimension of culture but also exploring its radical political potential.\\n\\nOur faculty members specialize in feminist and queer studies, critical race theory, film and media studies, museum studies, Latino/a studies, Africana studies, Asian Pacific Islander studies, and more. The CGU Cultural Studies Department is distinguished by offering both an MA and PhD in Cultural Studies. The department offers several concentrations, including Media Studies and Museum Studies, which are unique for their combination of a strong emphasis on cultural theory and hands-on practical experience. Students in the program can also choose to specialize in such transdisciplinary concentrations as American Studies, Early Modern Studies, or Hemispheric & Transnational Studies.\\n\\nInstruction in Cultural Studies is carried on in seminars. Classes are small and each student\\u2019s program individually designed. Students have considerable input in the design of their courses of study, including choice of concentrations and minor fields.\\n\\nBecause many students enter the program from other disciplines, the department offers a variety of introductory courses in addition to advanced-level courses. Students are required to take courses in research methodologies appropriate to their interests in Cultural Studies: possibilities include ethnographic field research methods, visual research methods, oral history, archival studies, digital humanities, and film or literary theory and analysis.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nCultural Studies Department, Claremont Graduate University  \\nChair: David Luis-Brown  \\n831 N.

Both sets of 24 units must conform to the area requirements of the relevant institution and must be approved by the Program Committee.\\n*   All degree requirements must be completed within seven years (or six with the transfer of 24 units according to CGU regulations) from the time a student begins graduate study.\\n\\n**Residency Requirement**  \\nThe residency requirements for the PhD degree may be met either by two semesters of full-time study in a 24-month period or by the completion of 48 units of course work within a 48-month period, including work in the summer session, on either or both campuses.\\n\\n**Research Tool**  \\nA student in the joint PhD program must demonstrate proficiency in problem-solving ability using computer programs. This demonstration may take different forms depending on the student\\u2019s engineering sub-discipline, but it must include evidence that the student has used an appropriate computer language and an algorithmic method to solve a problem from an engineering discipline.\\n\\n**Preliminary Examinations**  \\nThe student is required to pass written preliminary examinations. These examinations consist of two examination areas: one in engineering and one in mathematics.\\n\\n**Research Preparation**  \\nOn completion of at least 48 units of course work (including transfer units) and completion of the preliminary examinations and research tool test, a student embarks on the research phase of the joint doctoral program. In preparation for the research phase, the student is expected to spend at least a semester in advanced graduate courses, seminars, or directed reading courses, where exposure to research material is emphasized.\\n\\n**Research Proposal and Qualifying Examination**  \\nThe student will define an area of proposed research and prepare a written dissertation proposal containing an outline of the research to be undertaken and references to relevant source materials. The dissertation proposal is presented to the doctoral committee at least two weeks prior to the qualifying examination. The qualifying examination is an oral presentation to the doctoral committee by the student describing the research planned. The student is expected to present evidence both as to the mathematical content and to the engineering application of the proposed research, supporting such evidence with references to previous research work in both areas.\\n\\n**Advancement to Candidacy**  \\nAfter successful completion of the qualifying examination and certification that all other requirements are fulfilled, the student is advanced to candidacy.\\n\\n**Dissertation and Final Oral Examination**  \\nOn completion of the research, the student will prepare the Dissertation in accordance with CGU regulations. A final draft of the dissertation will be presented to each member of the doctoral committee at least three weeks prior to the final oral examination. The oral defense will be held on the campus of the dissertation supervisor.\\n\\nResources\\n---------\\n\\n**Engineering & Computational Mathematics Clinic**  \\nCGU\\u2019s internationally recognized Engineering & Computational Mathematics Clinic offers first-hand experience solving significant mathematical problems for industry and government clients.\\n\\nRecent projects include:\\n\\n*   Optimizing Transmission of Renewable Energy\\u2013Southern California Edison\\n*   Hardware-Software Codesign\\u2013Los Alamos National Laboratory\\n*   Data Cohort Analysis\\u2013Fair Isaac\\n*   Optimizing Smart Power Grids\\u2013Los Alamos National Laboratory\\n*   Credit Risk in a Network Economy\\u2013Fitch Rating\\n*   Isogeometric Analysis\\u2013Boeing\\n*   Gate to Base Capacitance Modeling for Nanoscale MOSFETs\\u2013USC Information Sciences Institute\\n*   Practical Semi-Analytic Model for the Substrate Current of Short Channel MOSFETs with LDDs\\u2013USC Information Sciences Institute\\n\\n[LEARN MORE](https://research.cgu.edu/mathematics-clinic/)\\n\\n**Claremont Center for the Mathematical Sciences**  \\nThrough the Claremont Center for the Mathematical Sciences (CCMS), you\\u2019ll have access to one of the largest mathematical science communities in California, as well as to workshops, conferences, and seminars, including:\\n\\n*   Southern California Analysis Seminar\\n*   Math-in-Industry Workshop\\n*   Michael E.

Siegel is a historian of the Holocaust specializing in medicine and medical practices during the Nazi regime. Her research situates Jewish prisoner-physicians in macro and micro contexts, revealing how both their assignment to medical posts in Nazi camps and their conduct in those posts expand our understanding of the Holocaust. Siegel has published several articles in venues such as _Holocaust and Genocide Studies_ and _Journal of Genocide Research_, and she is completing a book manuscript tentatively titled _Jewish Prisoner-Physicians During the Holocaust: Conscription, Circumstances, and Medical Conduct, 1940\\u20131945_. Dedicated to bringing the history of medicine under the Nazi regime and its implications to the awareness of current and prospective health professionals today, she has taught this subject matter to medical students as a guest instructor at the Yale School of Medicine, to undergraduates as a visiting assistant professor in history at UCLA, and to a broad audience as a postdoctoral fellow and subsequently as an assistant professor in the Cedars-Sinai Program in the History of Medicine. Siegel has been invited to present her research in numerous countries and is a member of the _Lancet_ Commission on Medicine, Nazism, and the Holocaust: Historical Evidence, Implications for Today, Teaching for Tomorrow, whose eponymous report will be published on November 9, 2023.\\n\\nSiegel holds a BA in history from Yale University and a PhD in history from the University of Southern California.\\n\\n(Co-authored work), \\u201cMedicine, Nazism, and the Holocaust: Historical Evidence, Implications for Today, Teaching for Tomorrow,\\u201d commission report for _The Lancet_, forthcoming\\n\\n\\u201cThe Coercion-Resistance Spectrum: Analyzing Prisoner-Functionary Behaviour in Nazi Camps,\\u201d _Journal of Genocide Research_, 23 (2021): 17\\u201336\\n\\n\\u201cTreating an Auschwitz Prisoner-Physician: The Case of Dr. Maximilian Samuel,\\u201d _Holocaust and Genocide Studies_ 28 (2014): 450\\u2013481\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"Sari Siegel \\u00b7 Research Associate Professor\", \"source\": \"https://www.cgu.edu/people/sari-siegel/\"}}"]
